I have finally finished Atlas Shrugged and would like to take a moment to reflect on my interpretation of the idealogies portrayed throughout the book. To set the stage, Atlas Shrugged is a dystopian novel where productive individuals withdraw from a society that exploits them.

## Rational self interest

One of the core ideas of Atlas Shrugged is that the pursuit of one's self interest is morally good, not evil. This is in contrast to the conventional view that selflessness and self-sacrifice are virtuous.



What idealogies and or philosophy is portrayed?
- Rationalism. What does rationalism even mean?
- Individualism. What is this?
- Aka rational self-interest.

Economic
- Connection to Hayek.
