    "section": "Cumulative model",
    "text": "Cumulative model\nA cumulative model assumes that the observed ordinal variable \\(Y\\) originates from the “categorization” of a latent continuous variable \\(Z\\). To model the categorization process, the model assumes that there are \\(K\\) thresholds (or cutpoints) \\(\\tau_k\\) that partition \\(Z\\) into \\(K+1\\) observable, ordered categories of \\(Y\\). The subscript \\(k\\) in \\(\\tau_k\\) is an index that associates that threshold to a particular category \\(k\\). For example, if the response has three categories such as “disagree”, “neither agree nor disagree”, and “agree”, then there are two thresholds \\(\\tau_1\\) and \\(\\tau_2\\) that partition \\(Z\\) into \\(K+1 = 3\\) categories. Additionally, if we assume \\(Z\\) to have a certain distribution (e.g., Normal) with a cumulative distribution function \\(F\\), the probability of \\(Y\\) being equal to category \\(k\\) is\n\\[P(Y = k) = F(\\tau_k) - F(\\tau_{k-1})\\]\nwhere \\(F(\\tau)\\) is a cumulative probability. For example, suppose we are interested in the probability of each category stated above, and have two thresholds \\(\\tau_1 = -1, \\tau_2 = 1\\) for the three categories. Additionally, if we assume \\(Z\\) to be normally distributed with \\(\\sigma = 1\\) and a cumulative distribution function \\(\\Phi\\) then\n\\[P(Y = 1) = \\Phi(\\tau_1) = \\Phi(-1)\\]\n\\[P(Y = 2) = \\Phi(\\tau_2) - \\Phi(\\tau_1) = \\Phi(1) - \\Phi(-1)\\]\n\\[P(Y = 3) = 1 - \\Phi(\\tau_2) = 1 - \\Phi(1)\\]\nBut how to set the values of the thresholds? By default, Bambi uses a Normal distribution with a grid of evenly spaced \\(\\mu\\) that depends on the number of response levels as the prior for the thresholds. Additionally, since the thresholds need to be orderd, Bambi applies a transformation to the values such that the order is preserved. Furthermore, the model specification for ordinal regression typically transforms the cumulative probabilities using the log-cumulative-odds (logit) transformation. Therefore, the learned parameters for the thresholds \\(\\tau\\) will be logits.\nLastly, as each \\(F(\\tau)\\) implies a cumulative probability for each category, the largest response level always has a cumulative probability of 1. Thus, we effectively do not need a parameter for it due to the law of total probability. For example, for three response values, we only need two thresholds as two thresholds partition \\(Z\\) into \\(K+1\\) categories.\n\nThe moral intuition dataset\nTo illustrate an cumulative ordinal model, we will model data from a series of experiments conducted by philsophers (this example comes from Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking). The experiments aim to collect empirical evidence relevant to debates about moral intuition, the forms of reasoning through which people develop judgments about the moral goodness and badness of actions.\nIn the dataset there are 12 columns and 9930 rows, comprising data for 331 unique individuals. The response we are interested in response, is an integer from 1 to 7 indicating how morally permissible the participant found the action to be taken (or not) in the story. The predictors are as follows:\n\naction: a factor with levels 0 and 1 where 1 indicates that the story contained “harm caused by action is morally worse than equivalent harm caused by omission”.\nintention: a factor with levels 0 and 1 where 1 indicates that the story contained “harm intended as the means to a goal is morally worse than equivalent harm foreseen as the side effect of a goal”.\ncontact: a factor with levels 0 and 1 where 1 indicates that the story contained “using physical contact to cause harm to a victim is morally worse than causing equivalent harm to a victim without using physical contact”.\n\n\ntrolly = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/master/data/Trolley.csv\", sep=\";\")\ntrolly = trolly[[\"response\", \"action\", \"intention\", \"contact\"]]\ntrolly[\"action\"] = pd.Categorical(trolly[\"action\"], ordered=False)\ntrolly[\"intention\"] = pd.Categorical(trolly[\"intention\"], ordered=False)\ntrolly[\"contact\"] = pd.Categorical(trolly[\"contact\"], ordered=False)\ntrolly[\"response\"] = pd.Categorical(trolly[\"response\"], ordered=True)\n\n\n# 7 ordered categories from 1-7\ntrolly.response.unique()\n\n[4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 7, 6]\nCategories (7, int64): [1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 7]\n\n\n\n\nIntercept only model\nBefore we fit a model with predictors, let’s attempt to recover the parameters of an ordinal model using only the thresholds to get a feel for the cumulative family. Traditionally, in Bambi if we wanted to recover the parameters of the likelihood, we would use an intercept only model and write the formula as response ~ 1 where 1 indicates to include the intercept. However, in the case of ordinal regression, the thresholds “take the place” of the intercept. Thus, we can write the formula as response ~ 0 to indicate that we do not want to include an intercept. To fit a cumulative ordinal model, we pass family=\"cumulative\". To compare the thresholds only model, we compute the empirical log-cumulative-odds of the categories directly from the data below and generate a bar plot of the response probabilities.\n\npr_k = trolly.response.value_counts().sort_index().values / trolly.shape[0]\ncum_pr_k = np.cumsum(pr_k)\nlogit_func = lambda x: np.log(x / (1 - x))\ncum_logit = logit_func(cum_pr_k)\ncum_logit\n\n/var/folders/rl/y69t95y51g90tvd6gjzzs59h0000gn/T/ipykernel_22293/1548491577.py:3: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in log\n  logit_func = lambda x: np.log(x / (1 - x))\n\n\narray([-1.91609116, -1.26660559, -0.718634  ,  0.24778573,  0.88986365,\n        1.76938091,         nan])\n\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))\nplt.bar(np.arange(1, 8), pr_k)\nplt.ylabel(\"Probability\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Response\")\nplt.title(\"Empirical probability of each response category\");\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel = bmb.Model(\"response ~ 0\", data=trolly, family=\"cumulative\")\nidata = model.fit(random_seed=1234)\n\nBelow, the components of the model are outputed.

Why six? Remember, we get the last parameter for free. Since there are seven categories, we only need six cutpoints. The index (using zero based indexing) of the response_threshold indicates the category that the threshold is associated with. Comparing to the empirical log-cumulative-odds computation above, the mean of the posterior distribution for each category is close to the empirical value.\nAs the the log cumulative link is used, we need to apply the inverse of the logit function to transform back to cumulative probabilities. Below, we plot the cumulative probabilities for each category.\n\nexpit_func = lambda x: 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\ncumprobs = expit_func(idata.posterior.response_threshold).mean((\"chain\", \"draw\"))\ncumprobs = np.append(cumprobs, 1)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))\nplt.plot(sorted(trolly.response.unique()), cumprobs, marker='o')\nplt.ylabel(\"Cumulative probability\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Response category\")\nplt.title(\"Cumulative probabilities of response categories\");\n\n\n\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 3))\nfor i in range(6):\n    outcome = expit_func(idata.posterior.response_threshold).sel(response_threshold_dim=i).to_numpy().flatten()\n    ax.hist(outcome, bins=15, alpha=0.5, label=f\"Category: {i}\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Probability\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\nax.set_title(\"Cumulative Probability by Category\")\nax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.04, 1), loc=\"upper left\");\n\n\n\n\nWe can take the derivative of the cumulative probabilities to get the posterior probabilities for each category. Notice how the posterior probabilities in the barplot below are close to the empirical probabilities in barplot above.\n\n# derivative\nddx = np.diff(cumprobs)\nprobs = np.insert(ddx, 0, cumprobs[0])\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))\nplt.bar(sorted(trolly.response.unique()), probs)\nplt.ylabel(\"Probability\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Response category\")\nplt.title(\"Posterior Probability of each response category\");\n\n\n\n\nNotice in the plots above, the jump in probability from category 3 to 4. Additionally, the estimates of the coefficients is precise for each category. Now that we have an understanding how the cumulative link function is applied to produce ordered cumulative outcomes, we will add predictors to the model.\n\n\nAdding predictors\nIn the cumulative model described above, adding predictors was explicitly left out. In this section, it is described how predictors are added to ordinal cumulative models. When adding predictor variables, what we would like is for any predictor, as it increases, predictions are moved progressively (increased) through the categories in sequence. A linear regression is formed for \\(Z\\) by adding a predictor term \\(\\eta\\)\n\\[\\eta = \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 +, . . ., \\beta_n x_n\\]\nNotice how similar this looks to an ordinary linear model. However, there is no intercept or error term. This is because the intercept is replaced by the threshold \\(\\tau\\) and the error term \\(\\epsilon\\) is added seperately to obtain\n\\[Z = \\eta + \\epsilon\\]\nPutting the predictor term together with the thresholds and cumulative distribution function, we obtain the probability of \\(Y\\) being equal to a category \\(k\\) as\n\\[Pr(Y = k | \\eta) = F(\\tau_k - \\eta) - F(\\tau_{k-1} - \\eta)\\]\nThe same predictor term \\(\\eta\\) is subtracted from each threshold because if we decrease the log-cumulative-odds of every outcome value \\(k\\) below the maximum, this shifts probability mass upwards towards higher outcome values. Thus, positive \\(\\beta\\) values correspond to increasing \\(x\\), which is associated with an increase in the mean response \\(Y\\). The parameters to be estimated from the model are the thresholds \\(\\tau\\) and the predictor terms \\(\\eta\\) coefficients.\nTo add predictors for ordinal models in Bambi, we continue to use the formula interface.\n\nmodel = bmb.Model(\n    \"response ~ 0 + action + intention + contact + action:intention + contact:intention\", \n    data=trolly, \n    family=\"cumulative\"\n)\nidata = model.fit(random_seed=1234)\n\nIn the summary dataframe below, we only select the predictor variables as the thresholds are not of interest at the moment.\nIn the summary dataframe below, we only select the predictor variables as the cutpoints are not of interest at the moment.\n\naz.summary(\n    idata, \n    var_names=[\"action\", \"intention\", \"contact\", \n               \"action:intention\", \"contact:intention\"]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\naction[1]\n-0.466\n0.055\n-0.563\n-0.363\n0.003\n0.002\n412.0\n645.0\n1.00\n\n\nintention[1]\n-0.278\n0.060\n-0.390\n-0.167\n0.003\n0.002\n379.0\n500.0\n1.01\n\n\ncontact[1]\n-0.327\n0.072\n-0.460\n-0.204\n0.003\n0.002\n525.0\n688.0\n1.00\n\n\naction:intention[1, 1]\n-0.450\n0.080\n-0.609\n-0.300\n0.004\n0.003\n396.0\n479.0\n1.00\n\n\ncontact:intention[1, 1]\n-1.278\n0.097\n-1.459\n-1.098\n0.004\n0.003\n557.0\n567.0\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posterior distribution of the slopes are all negative indicating that each of these story features reduces the rating—the acceptability of the story. Below, a forest plot is used to make this insight more clear.\n\naz.plot_forest(\n    idata,\n    combined=True,\n    var_names=[\"action\", \"intention\", \"contact\", \n               \"action:intention\", \"contact:intention\"],\n    figsize=(7, 3),\n    textsize=11\n);\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we can plot the cumulative probability of each category. Compared to the same plot above, notice how most of the category probabilities have been shifted to the left. Additionally, there is more uncertainty for category 3, 4, and 5.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 3))\nfor i in range(6):\n    outcome = expit_func(idata.posterior.response_threshold).sel(response_threshold_dim=i).to_numpy().flatten()\n    ax.hist(outcome, bins=15, alpha=0.5, label=f\"Category: {i}\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Probability\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\nax.set_title(\"Cumulative Probability by Category\")\nax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.04, 1), loc=\"upper left\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior predictive distribution\nTo get a sense of how well the ordinal model fits the data, we can plot samples from the posterior predictive distribution. To plot the samples, a utility function is defined below to assist in the plotting of discrete values.\n\ndef adjust_lightness(color, amount=0.5):\n    import matplotlib.colors as mc\n    import colorsys\n    try:\n        c = mc.cnames[color]\n    except:\n        c = color\n    c = colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*mc.to_rgb(c))\n    return colorsys.hls_to_rgb(c[0], c[1] * amount, c[2])\n\ndef plot_ppc_discrete(idata, bins, ax):\n    \n    def add_discrete_bands(x, lower, upper, ax, **kwargs):\n        for i, (l, u) in enumerate(zip(lower, upper)):\n            s = slice(i, i + 2)\n            ax.fill_between(x[s], [l, l], [u, u], **kwargs)\n\n    var_name = list(idata.observed_data.data_vars)[0]\n    y_obs = idata.observed_data[var_name].to_numpy()\n    \n    counts_list = []\n    for draw_values in az.extract(idata, \"posterior_predictive\")[var_name].to_numpy().T:\n        counts, _ = np.histogram(draw_values, bins=bins)\n        counts_list.append(counts)\n    counts_arr = np.stack(counts_list)\n\n    qts_90 = np.quantile(counts_arr, (0.05, 0.95), axis=0)\n    qts_70 = np.quantile(counts_arr, (0.15, 0.85), axis=0)\n    qts_50 = np.quantile(counts_arr, (0.25, 0.75), axis=0)\n    qts_30 = np.quantile(counts_arr, (0.35, 0.65), axis=0)\n    median = np.quantile(counts_arr, 0.5, axis=0)\n\n    colors = [adjust_lightness(\"C0\", x) for x in [1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, 0.9]]\n\n    add_discrete_bands(bins, qts_90[0], qts_90[1], ax=ax, color=colors[0])\n    add_discrete_bands(bins, qts_70[0], qts_70[1], ax=ax, color=colors[1])\n    add_discrete_bands(bins, qts_50[0], qts_50[1], ax=ax, color=colors[2])\n    add_discrete_bands(bins, qts_30[0], qts_30[1], ax=ax, color=colors[3])\n\n    \n    ax.step(bins[:-1], median, color=colors[4], lw=2, where=\"post\")\n    ax.hist(y_obs, bins=bins, histtype=\"step\", lw=2, color=\"black\", align=\"mid\")\n    handles = [\n        Line2D([], [], label=\"Observed data\", color=\"black\", lw=2),\n        Line2D([], [], label=\"Posterior predictive median\", color=colors[4], lw=2)\n    ]\n    ax.legend(handles=handles)\n    return ax\n\n\nidata_pps = model.predict(idata=idata, kind=\"pps\", inplace=False)\n\nbins = np.arange(7)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 3))\nax = plot_ppc_discrete(idata_pps, bins, ax)\nax.set_xlabel(\"Response category\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\nax.set_title(\"Cumulative model - Posterior Predictive Distribution\");"

    "section": "Sequential Model",
    "text": "Sequential Model\nFor some ordinal variables, the assumption of a single underlying continuous variable (as in cumulative models) may not be appropriate. If the response can be understood as being the result of a sequential process, such that a higher response category is possible only after all lower categories are achieved, then a sequential model may be more appropriate than a cumulative model.\nSequential models assume that for every category \\(k\\) there is a latent continuous variable \\(Z\\) that determines the transition between categories \\(k\\) and \\(k+1\\). Now, a threshold \\(\\tau\\) belongs to each latent process. If there are 3 categories, then there are 3 latent processes. If \\(Z_k\\) is greater than the threshold \\(\\tau_k\\), the sequential process continues, otherwise it stops at category \\(k\\). As with the cumulative model, we assume a distribution for \\(Z_k\\) with a cumulative distribution function \\(F\\).\nAs an example, lets suppose we are interested in modeling the probability a boxer makes it to round 3. This implies that the particular boxer in question survived round 1 \\(Z_1 &gt; \\tau_1\\) , 2 \\(Z_2 &gt; \\tau_2\\), and 3 \\(Z_3 &gt; \\tau_3\\). This can be written as\n\\[Pr(Y = 3) = (1 - P(Z_1 \\leq \\tau_1)) * (1 - P(Z_2 \\leq \\tau_2)) * P(Z_3 \\leq \\tau_3)\\]\nAs in the cumulative model above, if we assume \\(Y\\) to be normally distributed with the thresholds \\(\\tau_1 = -1, \\tau_2 = 0, \\tau_3 = 1\\) and cumulative distribution function \\(\\Phi\\) then\n\\[Pr(Y = 3) = (1 - \\Phi(\\tau_1)) * (1 - \\Phi(\\tau_2)) * \\Phi(\\tau_3)\\]\nTo add predictors to this sequential model, we follow the same specification in the Adding Predictors section above. Thus, the sequential model with predictor terms becomes\n\\[P(Y = k) = F(\\tau_k - \\eta) * \\prod_{j=1}^{k-1}{(1 - F(\\tau_j - \\eta))}\\]\nThus, the probability that \\(Y\\) is equal to category \\(k\\) is equal to the probability that it did not fall in one of the former categories \\(1: k-1\\) multiplied by the probability that the sequential process stopped at \\(k\\) rather than continuing past it.\n\nHuman resources attrition dataset\nTo illustrate an sequential model with a stopping ratio link function, we will use data from the IBM human resources employee attrition and performance dataset. The original dataset contains 1470 rows and 35 columns. However, our goal is to model the total working years of employees using age as a predictor. This data lends itself to a sequential model as the response, total working years, is a sequential process. In order to have 10 years of working experience, it is necessarily true that the employee had 9 years of working experience. Additionally, age is choosen as a predictor as it is positively correlated with total working years.\n\nattrition = pd.read_csv(\"data/hr_employee_attrition.tsv.txt\", sep=\"\\t\")\nattrition = attrition[attrition[\"Attrition\"] == \"No\"]\nattrition[\"YearsAtCompany\"] = pd.Categorical(attrition[\"YearsAtCompany\"], ordered=True)\nattrition[[\"YearsAtCompany\", \"Age\"]].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYearsAtCompany\nAge\n\n\n\n\n1\n10\n49\n\n\n3\n8\n33\n\n\n4\n2\n27\n\n\n5\n7\n32\n\n\n6\n1\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, the empirical probabilities of the response categories are computed. Employees are most likely to stay at the company between 1 and 10 years.\n\npr_k = attrition.YearsAtCompany.value_counts().sort_index().values / attrition.shape[0]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))\nplt.bar(np.arange(0, 36), pr_k)\nplt.xlabel(\"Response category\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Probability\")\nplt.title(\"Empirical probability of each response category\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault prior of thresholds\nBefore we fit the sequential model, it’s worth mentioning that the default priors for the thresholds in a sequential model are different than the cumulative model. In the cumulative model, the default prior for the thresholds is a Normal distribution with a grid of evenly spaced \\(\\mu\\) where an ordered transformation is applied to ensure the ordering of the values. However, in the sequential model, the ordering of the thresholds does not matter. Thus, the default prior for the thresholds is a Normal distribution with a zero \\(\\mu\\) vector of length \\(k - 1\\) where \\(k\\) is the number of response levels. Refer to the getting started docs if you need a refresher on priors in Bambi.\nSubsequently, fitting a sequential model is similar to fitting a cumulative model.

Remember, the sequential model is a product of probabilities, i.e., the probability that \\(Y\\) is equal to category \\(k\\) is equal to the probability that it did not fall in one of the former categories \\(1: k-1\\) multiplied by the probability that the sequential process stopped at \\(k\\). Thus, the probability of category 5 is the probability that the sequential process did not fall in 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 multiplied by the probability that the sequential process stopped at 5. This makes sense why the probability of category 36 is 1. There is no category after 36, so once you multiply all of the previous probabilities with the current category, you get 1. This is the reason for the “cumulative-like” shape of the plot. But if the coefficients were truly cumulative, the probability could not decreases as \\(k\\) increases.\n\n\nPosterior predictive samples\nAgain, using the posterior predictive samples, we can visualize the model fit against the observed data. In the case of the sequential model, the model does an alright job of capturing the observed frequencies of the categories. For pedagogical purposes, this fit is sufficient.\n\nidata_pps = model.predict(idata=idata, kind=\"pps\", inplace=False)\n\nbins = np.arange(35)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 3))\nax = plot_ppc_discrete(idata_pps, bins, ax)\nax.set_xlabel(\"Response category\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\nax.set_title(\"Sequential model - Posterior Predictive Distribution\");"

    "text": "Summary\nThis notebook demonstrated how to fit cumulative and sequential ordinal regression models using Bambi. Cumulative models focus on modeling the cumulative probabilities of an ordinal outcome variable taking on values up to and including a certain category, whereas a sequential model focuses on modeling the probability that an ordinal outcome variable stops at a particular category, rather than continuing to higher categories. To achieve this, both models assume that the reponse variable originates from a categorization of a latent continuous variable \\(Z\\). However, the cumulative model assumes that there are \\(K\\) thresholds \\(\\tau_k\\) that partition \\(Z\\) into \\(K+1\\) observable, ordered categories of \\(Y\\). The sequential model assumes that for every category \\(k\\) there is a latent continuous variable \\(Z\\) that determines the transition between categories \\(k\\) and \\(k+1\\); thus, a threshold \\(\\tau\\) belongs to each latent process.\nCumulative models can be used in situations where the outcome variable is on the Likert scale, and you are interested in understanding the impact of predictors on the probability of reaching or exceeding specific categories. Sequential models are particularly useful when you are interested in understanding the predictors that influence the decision to stop at a specific response level. It’s well-suited for analyzing data where categories represent stages, and the focus is on the transitions between these stages.\n\n%load_ext watermark\n%watermark -n -u -v -iv -w\n\nLast updated: Fri Sep 15 2023\n\nPython implementation: CPython\nPython version       : 3.11.0\nIPython version      : 8.13.2\n\nbambi     : 0.13.0.dev0\narviz     : 0.15.1\nnumpy     : 1.24.2\npandas    : 2.0.1\nmatplotlib: 3.7.1\n\nWatermark: 2.3.1"

    "title": "Inference - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo from Scratch",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Many MCMC algorithms perform poorly in high dimensions as they rely on a form of random searches based on local perturbations. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), however, leverages gradient information to guide the local moves and propose new states. The gradients of the log probability of the posterior evaluated at some state provides information of the geometry of the posterior density function. HMC attempts to avoid the random walk behavior typical of Metropolis-Hastings by using the gradient to propose new positions far from the current one with high acceptance probability. This allows HMC to scale to higher dimensions and in principle more complex posterior geometries.\n\nHamiltonian Mechanics in a Statistical Setting\nHMC gets its name from Hamiltonian mechanics. The field of mechanics can be used to describe simple systems such as a bouncing ball, a pendulum or an oscillating spring in which energy changes from kinetic to potential and back again over time. Consider a skateboarder riding in an empty pool. We can characterize the skateboarder in terms of their position \\(\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^D\\) denoted \\(q\\) and momentum \\(v \\in \\mathbb{R}^D\\), denoted \\(p\\). The set of all possible values for (\\(q, p\\)) the skateboarder can take on is called the phase space. The Hamiltonian function is a description of the total energy of a physical system and is defined as:\n\\[\\mathcal{H}(q, p) = \\mathcal{E}(q) + \\mathcal{K}(p)\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{E}(q)\\) is the potential energy, and \\(\\mathcal{K}(p)\\) is the kinetic energy. \\(\\mathcal{H}(q, p)\\) is the total energy. However, since we are operating in a statistical, not a physical, setting, the potential energy is a log probability density function (logpdf) such as \\(p(q, D)\\):\n\\[\\mathcal{E}(q) = -log\\tilde{p}(q)\\]\nand kinetic energy is:\n\\[\\mathcal{K} = \\frac{1}{2}p^T\\sum^{-1}p\\]\nwhere \\(\\sum\\) is a positive-definite matrix, known as the inverse mass matrix. Why is kinetic energy this way? We are free to choose the kinetic energy, and if we choose it to be Gaussian, and drop the normalization constant, we get the \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) above.\nTo run the physics simulation, one must solve the continuous time differential equations, known as Hamilton’s equations:\n\\[\\frac{dq}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{K}}{\\partial p}\\]\n\\[\\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial q} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial q}\\]\n\nConservation of Energy\nSince we are running a physics simulation, total energy must be conserved. Intuitively, a satellite in orbit around a planet will “want” to continue in a straight line due to its momentum, but will get pulled in towards the planet due to gravity, and if these forces cancel out, the orbit is stable. If the satellite beings spiraling towards the planet, its kinetic energy will increase but its potential energy will decrease. In our statistical setting, if total energy is not conserved, then this means there were divergences and our numerical approximation went bad.\n\n\n\nLeapfrog Integrator\nTo simulate the differential equations above, we must first discretize \\(t\\), and go back and forth updating \\(q\\) and \\(p\\). However, this “back and forth” is not so straightforward. It turns out, one way to simulate Hamiltonian dynamics, is with a method called the leapfrog integrator.\nThis integrator first performs a half update of the momentum \\(p\\), then a full update of the position \\(q\\), and then finally another half update of the momentum.\n\\[\\underbrace{v_{t+1/2} = v_t - \\frac{\\eta}{2} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}(q_t)}{\\partial q}}_{\\text{half update}}\\]\n\\[\\underbrace{q_{t+1} = q_t + \\eta \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{K}(p_{t+1/2})}{\\partial p}}_{\\text{full update}}\\]\n\\[\\underbrace{v_{t+1} = v_{t+1/2} - \\frac{\\eta}{2} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}(q_{t+1})}{\\partial q}}_{\\text{half update}}\\]\nThe leapfrog integrator has two important parameters: (1) path length, and (2) step size \\(\\eta\\). In the simululation, the path length represents how “long” you travel before collecting another sample. The step size indicates the size each step is in the path length and determines how fine grained the simulation is. For example, in the drawing below, imagine path length \\(=1\\) for both simulations. However, the left simulation has a step size \\(=4\\) whereas the right simulation has a step size \\(=2\\). These parameters are important in determining how the simulator collects samples of the geometry of the posterior.\n\n\n\nleapfrog\n\n\n\n\nMain Idea\nHMC says the log posterior is like a “bowl” (the empty pool in the figure below), with the highest posterior probability at the center of the valley. If we give the skateboarder a flick, this momentum will simulate its path. It must obey physics, gliding along until we stop the clock and take a sample. If the log posterior is flat, then not much information is in the likelihood & prior and the skateboarder will glide before the gradient makes it turn around. However, if the geometry of the log posterior is not flat, like the pool below, the gradient will make the skateboarder turn around and back into the valley. Since HMC runs a physics simulation, certain things must be conserved, i.e., the total energy of the system.\n\n\n\nskateboarder\n\n\nHMC needs a few things to run: 1. A function or callable that returns the negative log probability of the data at the current position \\(q\\) 2. A means of returning the gradient of the negative log probability at the current position \\(q\\) 3. An integrator for simulating the Hamiltonian equations in discrete time with two parameters: - step size - path length\nThe algorithm for running HMC is to: set the initial position \\(q\\) to \\(q'_0 = q_{t-1}\\), and sample a new random momentum \\(p' \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sum)\\). Then, initialize a random trajectory in the phase space, starting at (\\(q'_0, p'_0\\)), followed for \\(L\\) leapfrog steps until we get to the new proposed state (\\(q^*, p^*\\)) \\(=\\) (\\(q'_L, p'_L\\)). With the new proposed state, we compute the MH acceptance probability. This process is ran \\(n\\) times, according the number of samples the user wants to collect.\n\n\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo - Multivariate Normal\nThe HMC implementation below is heavily inspired by Colin Carroll’s implementation.

    "title": "Advanced Interpret Usage in Bambi",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The interpret module is inspired by the R package marginaleffects and ports the core functionality of {marginaleffects} to Bambi. To close the gap of non-supported functionality in Bambi, interpret now provides a set of helper functions to aid the user in more advanced and complex analysis not covered within the comparisons, predictions, and slopes functions.\nThese helper functions are data_grid and select_draws. The data_grid can be used to create a pairwise grid of data points for the user to pass to model.predict. Subsequently, select_draws is used to select the draws from the posterior (or posterior predictive) group of the InferenceData object returned by the predict method that correspond to the data points that “produced” that draw.\nWith access to the appropriately indexed draws, and data used to generate those draws, it enables for more complex analysis such as cross-comparisons and the choice of which model parameter to compute a quantity of interest for. Additionally, the user has more control over the data passed to model.predict. Below, it will be demonstrated how to use these helper functions. First, to reproduce the results from the standard interpret API, and then to compute cross-comparisons.\n\nimport warnings\n\nimport arviz as az\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport bambi as bmb\n\nfrom bambi.interpret.helpers import data_grid, select_draws\n\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)\n\n\n\nWe will adopt the zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) model from the comparisons documentation to demonstrate the helper functions introduced above.\nThe ZIP model will be used to predict how many fish are caught by visitors at a state park using survey data. Many visitors catch zero fish, either because they did not fish at all, or because they were unlucky. We would like to explicitly model this bimodal behavior (zero versus non-zero) using a Zero Inflated Poisson model, and to compare how different inputs of interest \\(w\\) and other covariate values \\(c\\) are associated with the number of fish caught. The dataset contains data on 250 groups that went to a state park to fish. Each group was questioned about how many fish they caught (count), how many children were in the group (child), how many people were in the group (persons), if they used a live bait and whether or not they brought a camper to the park (camper).\n\nfish_data = pd.read_stata(\"http://www.stata-press.com/data/r11/fish.dta\")\ncols = [\"count\", \"livebait\", \"camper\", \"persons\", \"child\"]\nfish_data = fish_data[cols]\nfish_data[\"child\"] = fish_data[\"child\"].astype(np.int8)\nfish_data[\"persons\"] = fish_data[\"persons\"].astype(np.int8)\nfish_data[\"livebait\"] = pd.Categorical(fish_data[\"livebait\"])\nfish_data[\"camper\"] = pd.Categorical(fish_data[\"camper\"])\n\n\nfish_model = bmb.Model(\n    \"count ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\", \n    fish_data, \n    family='zero_inflated_poisson'\n)\n\nfish_idata = fish_model.fit(random_seed=1234)\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [count_psi, Intercept, livebait, camper, persons, child]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 3 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:02&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\ndata_grid allows you to create a pairwise grid, also known as a cross-join or cartesian product, of data using the covariates passed to the conditional and the optional variable parameter. Covariates not passed to conditional, but are terms in the Bambi model, are set to typical values (e.g., mean or mode). If you are coming from R, this function is partially inspired from the data_grid function in {modelr}.\nThere are two ways to create a pairwise grid of data:\n\nuser-provided values are passed as a dictionary to conditional where the keys are the names of the covariates and the values are the values to use in the grid.\na list of covariates where the elements are the names of the covariates to use in the grid. As only the names of the covariates were passed, default values are computed to construct the grid.\n\nAny unspecified covariates, i.e., covariates not passed to conditional but are terms in the Bambi model, are set to their “typical” values such as mean or mode depending on the data type of the covariate.\n\n\nTo construct a pairwise grid of data for specific covariate values, pass a dictionary to conditional. The values of the dictionary can be of type int, float, list, or np.ndarray.\n\nconditional = {\n    \"camper\": np.array([0, 1]),\n    \"persons\": np.arange(1, 5, 1),\n    \"child\": np.array([1, 2, 3]),\n}\nuser_passed_grid = data_grid(fish_model, conditional)\nuser_passed_grid.query(\"camper == 0\")\n\nDefault computed for unspecified variable: livebait\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncamper\npersons\nchild\nlivebait\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1.0\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n2\n1.0\n\n\n2\n0\n1\n3\n1.0\n\n\n3\n0\n2\n1\n1.0\n\n\n4\n0\n2\n2\n1.0\n\n\n5\n0\n2\n3\n1.0\n\n\n6\n0\n3\n1\n1.0\n\n\n7\n0\n3\n2\n1.0\n\n\n8\n0\n3\n3\n1.0\n\n\n9\n0\n4\n1\n1.0\n\n\n10\n0\n4\n2\n1.0\n\n\n11\n0\n4\n3\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsetting by camper = 0, it can be seen that a combination of all possible pairs of values from the dictionary (including the unspecified variable livebait) results in a dataframe containing every possible combination of values from the original sets. livebait has been set to 1 as this is the mode of the unspecified categorical variable.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, a list of covariates can be passed to conditional where the elements are the names of the covariates to use in the grid. By doing this, you are telling interpret to compute default values for these covariates. The psuedocode below outlines the logic and functions used to compute these default values:\nif is_numeric_dtype(x) or is_float_dtype(x):\n    values = np.linspace(np.min(x), np.max(x), 50)\n\nelif is_integer_dtype(x):\n    values = np.quantile(x, np.linspace(0, 1, 5))\n\nelif is_categorical_dtype(x) or is_string_dtype(x) or is_object_dtype(x):\n    values = np.unique(x)\n\nconditional = [\"camper\", \"persons\", \"child\"]\ndefault_grid = data_grid(fish_model, conditional)\n\ndefault_grid.shape, user_passed_grid.shape\n\nDefault computed for conditional variable: camper, persons, child\nDefault computed for unspecified variable: livebait\n\n\n((32, 4), (24, 4))\n\n\nNotice how the resulting length is different between the user passed and default grid. This is due to the fact that values for child range from 0 to 3 for the default grid.\n\ndefault_grid.query(\"camper == 0\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncamper\npersons\nchild\nlivebait\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.0\n1\n0\n1.0\n\n\n1\n0.0\n1\n1\n1.0\n\n\n2\n0.0\n1\n2\n1.0\n\n\n3\n0.0\n1\n3\n1.0\n\n\n4\n0.0\n2\n0\n1.0\n\n\n5\n0.0\n2\n1\n1.0\n\n\n6\n0.0\n2\n2\n1.0\n\n\n7\n0.0\n2\n3\n1.0\n\n\n8\n0.0\n3\n0\n1.0\n\n\n9\n0.0\n3\n1\n1.0\n\n\n10\n0.0\n3\n2\n1.0\n\n\n11\n0.0\n3\n3\n1.0\n\n\n12\n0.0\n4\n0\n1.0\n\n\n13\n0.0\n4\n1\n1.0\n\n\n14\n0.0\n4\n2\n1.0\n\n\n15\n0.0\n4\n3\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use data_grid to help generate data in computing comparisons or slopes, additional data is passed to the optional variable parameter. The name variable is an abstraction for the comparisons parameter contrast and slopes parameter wrt. If you have used any of the interpret functions, these parameter names should be familiar and the use of data_grid should be analogous to comparisons, predictions, and slopes.\nvariable can also be passed user-provided data (as a dictionary), or a string indicating the name of the covariate of interest. If the latter, a default value will be computed. Additionally, if an argument is passed for variable, then the effect_type needs to be passed. This is because for comparisons and slopes an epsilon value eps needs to be determined to compute the centered and finite difference, respectively. You can also pass a value for eps as a kwarg.\n\nconditional = {\n    \"camper\": np.array([0, 1]),\n    \"persons\": np.arange(1, 5, 1),\n    \"child\": np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n}\nvariable = \"livebait\"\n\ngrid = data_grid(fish_model, conditional, variable, effect_type=\"comparisons\")\n\nDefault computed for contrast variable: livebait\n\n\n\nidata_grid = fish_model.predict(fish_idata, data=grid, inplace=False)\n\n\n\nThe second helper function to aid in more advanced analysis is select_draws. This is a function that selects the posterior or posterior predictive draws from the ArviZ InferenceData object returned by model.predict given a conditional dictionary. The conditional dictionary represents the values that correspond to that draw.\nFor example, if we wanted to select posterior draws where livebait = [0, 1], then all we need to do is pass a dictionary where the key is the name of the covariate and the value is the value that we want to condition on (or select). The resulting InferenceData object will contain the draws that correspond to the data points where livebait = [0, 1]. Additionally, you must pass the InferenceData object returned by model.predict, the data used to generate the predictions, and the name of the data variable data_var you would like to select from the InferenceData posterior group. If you specified to return the posterior predictive samples by passing model.predict(..., kind=\"pps\"), you can use this group instead of the posterior group by passing group=\"posterior_predictive\".\nBelow, it is demonstrated how to compute comparisons for count_mean for the contrast livebait = [0, 1] using the posterior draws.\n\nidata_grid\n\n\n\n            \n

    "text": "data_grid allows you to create a pairwise grid, also known as a cross-join or cartesian product, of data using the covariates passed to the conditional and the optional variable parameter. Covariates not passed to conditional, but are terms in the Bambi model, are set to typical values (e.g., mean or mode). If you are coming from R, this function is partially inspired from the data_grid function in {modelr}.\nThere are two ways to create a pairwise grid of data:\n\nuser-provided values are passed as a dictionary to conditional where the keys are the names of the covariates and the values are the values to use in the grid.\na list of covariates where the elements are the names of the covariates to use in the grid. As only the names of the covariates were passed, default values are computed to construct the grid.\n\nAny unspecified covariates, i.e., covariates not passed to conditional but are terms in the Bambi model, are set to their “typical” values such as mean or mode depending on the data type of the covariate.\n\n\nTo construct a pairwise grid of data for specific covariate values, pass a dictionary to conditional. The values of the dictionary can be of type int, float, list, or np.ndarray.\n\nconditional = {\n    \"camper\": np.array([0, 1]),\n    \"persons\": np.arange(1, 5, 1),\n    \"child\": np.array([1, 2, 3]),\n}\nuser_passed_grid = data_grid(fish_model, conditional)\nuser_passed_grid.query(\"camper == 0\")\n\nDefault computed for unspecified variable: livebait\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncamper\npersons\nchild\nlivebait\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1.0\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n2\n1.0\n\n\n2\n0\n1\n3\n1.0\n\n\n3\n0\n2\n1\n1.0\n\n\n4\n0\n2\n2\n1.0\n\n\n5\n0\n2\n3\n1.0\n\n\n6\n0\n3\n1\n1.0\n\n\n7\n0\n3\n2\n1.0\n\n\n8\n0\n3\n3\n1.0\n\n\n9\n0\n4\n1\n1.0\n\n\n10\n0\n4\n2\n1.0\n\n\n11\n0\n4\n3\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsetting by camper = 0, it can be seen that a combination of all possible pairs of values from the dictionary (including the unspecified variable livebait) results in a dataframe containing every possible combination of values from the original sets. livebait has been set to 1 as this is the mode of the unspecified categorical variable.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, a list of covariates can be passed to conditional where the elements are the names of the covariates to use in the grid. By doing this, you are telling interpret to compute default values for these covariates. The psuedocode below outlines the logic and functions used to compute these default values:\nif is_numeric_dtype(x) or is_float_dtype(x):\n    values = np.linspace(np.min(x), np.max(x), 50)\n\nelif is_integer_dtype(x):\n    values = np.quantile(x, np.linspace(0, 1, 5))\n\nelif is_categorical_dtype(x) or is_string_dtype(x) or is_object_dtype(x):\n    values = np.unique(x)\n\nconditional = [\"camper\", \"persons\", \"child\"]\ndefault_grid = data_grid(fish_model, conditional)\n\ndefault_grid.shape, user_passed_grid.shape\n\nDefault computed for conditional variable: camper, persons, child\nDefault computed for unspecified variable: livebait\n\n\n((32, 4), (24, 4))\n\n\nNotice how the resulting length is different between the user passed and default grid. This is due to the fact that values for child range from 0 to 3 for the default grid.\n\ndefault_grid.query(\"camper == 0\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncamper\npersons\nchild\nlivebait\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.0\n1\n0\n1.0\n\n\n1\n0.0\n1\n1\n1.0\n\n\n2\n0.0\n1\n2\n1.0\n\n\n3\n0.0\n1\n3\n1.0\n\n\n4\n0.0\n2\n0\n1.0\n\n\n5\n0.0\n2\n1\n1.0\n\n\n6\n0.0\n2\n2\n1.0\n\n\n7\n0.0\n2\n3\n1.0\n\n\n8\n0.0\n3\n0\n1.0\n\n\n9\n0.0\n3\n1\n1.0\n\n\n10\n0.0\n3\n2\n1.0\n\n\n11\n0.0\n3\n3\n1.0\n\n\n12\n0.0\n4\n0\n1.0\n\n\n13\n0.0\n4\n1\n1.0\n\n\n14\n0.0\n4\n2\n1.0\n\n\n15\n0.0\n4\n3\n1.0"

    "text": "To use data_grid to help generate data in computing comparisons or slopes, additional data is passed to the optional variable parameter. The name variable is an abstraction for the comparisons parameter contrast and slopes parameter wrt. If you have used any of the interpret functions, these parameter names should be familiar and the use of data_grid should be analogous to comparisons, predictions, and slopes.\nvariable can also be passed user-provided data (as a dictionary), or a string indicating the name of the covariate of interest. If the latter, a default value will be computed. Additionally, if an argument is passed for variable, then the effect_type needs to be passed. This is because for comparisons and slopes an epsilon value eps needs to be determined to compute the centered and finite difference, respectively. You can also pass a value for eps as a kwarg.\n\nconditional = {\n    \"camper\": np.array([0, 1]),\n    \"persons\": np.arange(1, 5, 1),\n    \"child\": np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n}\nvariable = \"livebait\"\n\ngrid = data_grid(fish_model, conditional, variable, effect_type=\"comparisons\")\n\nDefault computed for contrast variable: livebait\n\n\n\nidata_grid = fish_model.predict(fish_idata, data=grid, inplace=False)\n\n\n\nThe second helper function to aid in more advanced analysis is select_draws. This is a function that selects the posterior or posterior predictive draws from the ArviZ InferenceData object returned by model.predict given a conditional dictionary. The conditional dictionary represents the values that correspond to that draw.\nFor example, if we wanted to select posterior draws where livebait = [0, 1], then all we need to do is pass a dictionary where the key is the name of the covariate and the value is the value that we want to condition on (or select). The resulting InferenceData object will contain the draws that correspond to the data points where livebait = [0, 1]. Additionally, you must pass the InferenceData object returned by model.predict, the data used to generate the predictions, and the name of the data variable data_var you would like to select from the InferenceData posterior group. If you specified to return the posterior predictive samples by passing model.predict(..., kind=\"pps\"), you can use this group instead of the posterior group by passing group=\"posterior_predictive\".\nBelow, it is demonstrated how to compute comparisons for count_mean for the contrast livebait = [0, 1] using the posterior draws.\n\nidata_grid\n\n\n\n            \n

    "text": "My project “Better tools to interpret complex Bambi regression models” was completed under the organization of NumFOCUS, and mentors Tomás Capretto and Osvaldo Martin. Before I describe the project, objectives, and work completed, I would like to thank my mentors Tomás and Osvaldo for their precious time and support throughout the summer. They were always available and timely in communicating over Slack and GitHub, and provided valuable feedback during code reviews. Additionally, I would like to thank NumFOCUS and the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program for providing the opportunity to work on such an open source project over the summer. It has been an invaluable experience, and I look forward to contributing to open source projects in the future.\n\nProject Description\nBayesian modeling has increased significantly in academia and industry over the past years thanks to the development of high quality and user friendly open source probabilistic programming languages (PPL) in Python and R. Of these is Bambi, a Python library built on top of the PyMC PPL, that makes it easy to specify complex generalized linear multilevel models using a formula notation similar to those found in R. However, as the model building portion of the Bayesian workflow becomes easier, the interpretation of these models has not.\nTo aid in model interpretability, Bambi (before this project) had a sub-package plots that supported conditional adjusted predictions plots. The original objective was to extend upon the existing plotting functionality of conditional adjusted predictions by supporting the plotting of posterior predictive samples, and to provide the additional plotting functions predictive comparisons and predictive slopes. However, after discussion with my mentors, and taking inspiration from marginaleffects, it was decided that in addition to the plotting functions, the plots sub-package should also have functions that allow the user to return the dataframe used for plotting. For example, calling plot_slopes() would plot the slopes, and calling slopes() would return the dataframe used to plot the slopes. To this extent, the plots sub-package was renamed to interpret to better reflect all of the supported functionality. These three features allow Bambi modelers to compute and interpret three different “quantities of interest” in a more automatic and effective manner.\nThus, the three main deliverables of this project were to add (or enhance) the following functions in the interpret sub-package. Additionally, for each feature, tests and documentation need to be added:\n\nSupport posterior predictive samples (pps) in plot_predictions()\n\nWrite tests\nAdd documentation\n\nAdd comparisons() and plot_comparisons()\n\nWrite tests\nAdd documentation\n\nAdd slopes() and plot_slopes()\n\nWrite tests\nAdd documentation\n\n\n\n\nWork Completed\nAll three main deliverables (and their associated sub-deliverables) were completed (merged into the main branch of the Bambi repository) on time. In the table below, the name of the deliverable, link to the feature’s pull request (PR), and link to the documentation are provided.\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nFeature PR\nDocumentation PR\n\n\n\n\nAllow plot_predictions to plot posterior predictive samples\nPR #668\nPR #670\n\n\nAdd comparisons and plot_comparisons\nPR #684\nPR #695\n\n\nAdd slopes and plot_slopes\nPR #699\nPR #701\n\n\n\nIn order to quickly obtain a sense of the work completed over the GSoC program, it is probably best to view the documentation PRs. The documentation PRs consist of a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates: (1) why the new feature is useful in interpreting GLMs, (2) a brief overview of how the function computes the quantity of interest based on the user’s inputs, and (3) a demonstration of the function using different GLMs and datasets.\n\n\nFuture Work\nAs the PRs have been merged upstream, some Bambi users have already been utilizing the new sub-package. The feedback has been positive, and a GitHub issue has been opened to request additional functionality. Going forward, I will continue to contribute to Bambi, maintain the interpret sub-package, and interact with the Bambi community."

    "text": "Zero inflated outcomes\nSometimes, an observation is not generated from a single process, but from a mixture of processes. Whenever there is a mixture of processes generating an observation, a mixture model may be more appropriate. A mixture model uses more than one probability distribution to model the data. Count data are more susceptible to needing a mixture model as it is common to have a large number of zeros and values greater than zero. A zero means “nothing happened”, and this can be either because the rate of events is low, or because the process that generates the events was never “triggered”. For example, in health service utilization data (the number of times a patient used a service during a given time period), a large number of zeros represents patients with no utilization during the time period. However, some patients do use a service which is a result of some “triggered process”.\nThere are two popular classes of models for modeling zero-inflated data: (1) ZIP, and (2) hurdle Poisson. First, the ZIP model is described and how to implement it in Bambi is outlined. Subsequently, the hurdle Poisson model and how to implement it is outlined thereafter."

    "text": "Zero inflated poisson\nTo model zero-inflated outcomes, the ZIP model uses a distribution that mixes two data generating processes. The first process generates zeros, and the second process uses a Poisson distribution to generate counts (of which some may be zero). The result of this mixture is a distribution that can be described as\n\\[P(Y=0) = (1 - \\psi) + \\psi e^{-\\mu}\\]\n\\[P(Y=y_i) = \\psi \\frac{e^{-\\mu} \\mu_{i}^y}{y_{i}!} \\ \\text{for} \\ y_i = 1, 2, 3,...,n\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) is the outcome, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the Poisson process where \\(\\mu \\ge 0\\), and \\(\\psi\\) is the probability of the Poisson process where \\(0 \\lt \\psi \\lt 1\\). To understand how these two processes are “mixed”, let’s simulate some data using the two process equations above (taken from the PyMC docs).\n\nx = np.arange(0, 22)\npsis = [0.7, 0.4]\nmus = [10, 4]\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))\nfor psi, mu in zip(psis, mus):\n    pmf = stats.poisson.pmf(x, mu)\n    pmf[0] = (1 - psi) + pmf[0] # 1.) generate zeros\n    pmf[1:] =  psi * pmf[1:] # 2.) generate counts\n    pmf /= pmf.sum() # normalize to get probabilities\n    plt.plot(x, pmf, '-o', label='$\\\\psi$ = {}, $\\\\mu$ = {}'.format(psi, mu))\n\nplt.title(\"Zero Inflated Poisson Process\")\nplt.xlabel('x', fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel('f(x)', fontsize=12)\nplt.legend(loc=1)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the blue line, corresponding to a higher \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\mu\\), has a higher rate of counts and less zeros. Additionally, the inline comments above describe the first and second process generating the data.\n\nZIP regression model\nThe equations above only describe the ZIP distribution. However, predictors can be added to make this a regression model. Suppose we have a response variable \\(Y\\), which represents the number of events that occur during a time period, and \\(p\\) predictors \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_p\\). We can model the parameters of the ZIP distribution as a linear combination of the predictors.\n\\[Y_i \\sim \\text{ZIPoisson}(\\mu_i, \\psi_i)\\]\n\\[g(\\mu_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1i}+,...,+\\beta_p X_{pi}\\]\n\\[h(\\psi_i) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 X_{1i}+,...,+\\alpha_p X_{pi}\\]\nwhere \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) are the link functions for each parameter. Bambi, by default, uses the log link for \\(g\\) and the logit link for \\(h\\). Notice how there are two linear models and two link functions: one for each parameter in the \\(\\text{ZIPoisson}\\). The parameters of the linear model differ, because any predictor such as \\(X\\) may be associated differently with each part of the mixture. Actually, you don’t even need to use the same predictors in both linear models—but this beyond the scope of this notebook.\n\nThe fish dataset\nTo demonstrate the ZIP regression model, we model and predict how many fish are caught by visitors at a state park using survey data. Many visitors catch zero fish, either because they did not fish at all, or because they were unlucky. The dataset contains data on 250 groups that went to a state park to fish. Each group was questioned about how many fish they caught (count), how many children were in the group (child), how many people were in the group (persons), if they used a live bait (livebait) and whether or not they brought a camper to the park (camper).\n\nfish_data = pd.read_stata(\"http://www.stata-press.com/data/r11/fish.dta\")\ncols = [\"count\", \"livebait\", \"camper\", \"persons\", \"child\"]\nfish_data = fish_data[cols]\nfish_data[\"livebait\"] = pd.Categorical(fish_data[\"livebait\"])\nfish_data[\"camper\"] = pd.Categorical(fish_data[\"camper\"])\nfish_data = fish_data[fish_data[\"count\"] &lt; 60] # remove outliers\n\n\nfish_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\nlivebait\ncamper\npersons\nchild\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\n1\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\n2\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\n3\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n2.0\n1.0\n\n\n4\n1.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Excess zeros, and skewed count\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))\nsns.histplot(fish_data[\"count\"], discrete=True)\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Fish Caught\");\n\n\n\n\nTo fit a ZIP regression model, we pass family=zero_inflated_poisson to the bmb.Model constructor.\n\nzip_model = bmb.Model(\n    \"count ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\", \n    fish_data, \n    family='zero_inflated_poisson'\n)\n\nzip_idata = zip_model.fit(\n    draws=1000, \n    target_accept=0.95, \n    random_seed=1234, \n    chains=4\n)\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [count_psi, Intercept, livebait, camper, persons, child]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 4 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:03&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\nLets take a look at the model components. Why is there only one linear model and link function defined for \\(\\mu\\). Where is the linear model and link function for \\(\\psi\\)? By default, the “main” (or first) formula is defined for the parent parameter; in this case \\(\\mu\\). Since we didn’t pass an additional formula for the non-parent parameter \\(\\psi\\), \\(\\psi\\) was never modeled as a function of the predictors as explained above. If we want to model both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\psi\\) as a function of the predictor, we need to expicitly pass two formulas.\n\nzip_model\n\n       Formula: count ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\n        Family: zero_inflated_poisson\n          Link: mu = log\n  Observations: 248\n        Priors: \n    target = mu\n        Common-level effects\n            Intercept ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 9.5283)\n            livebait ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 7.2685)\n            camper ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 5.0733)\n            persons ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 2.2583)\n            child ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 2.9419)\n        \n        Auxiliary parameters\n            psi ~ Beta(alpha: 2.0, beta: 2.0)\n------\n* To see a plot of the priors call the .plot_priors() method.\n* To see a summary or plot of the posterior pass the object returned by .fit() to az.summary() or az.plot_trace()\n\n\n\nformula = bmb.Formula(\n    \"count ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\", # parent parameter mu\n    \"psi ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\"    # non-parent parameter psi\n)\n\nzip_model = bmb.Model(\n    formula, \n    fish_data, \n    family='zero_inflated_poisson'\n)\n\nzip_idata = zip_model.fit(\n    draws=1000, \n    target_accept=0.95, \n    random_seed=1234, \n    chains=4\n)\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [Intercept, livebait, camper, persons, child, psi_Intercept, psi_livebait, psi_camper, psi_persons, psi_child]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 6 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:05&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nzip_model\n\n       Formula: count ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\n                psi ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\n        Family: zero_inflated_poisson\n          Link: mu = log\n                psi = logit\n  Observations: 248\n        Priors: \n    target = mu\n        Common-level effects\n            Intercept ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 9.5283)\n            livebait ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 7.2685)\n            camper ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 5.0733)\n            persons ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 2.2583)\n            child ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 2.9419)\n    target = psi\n        Common-level effects\n            psi_Intercept ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n            psi_livebait ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n            psi_camper ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n            psi_persons ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n            psi_child ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n------\n* To see a plot of the priors call the .plot_priors() method.\n* To see a summary or plot of the posterior pass the object returned by .fit() to az.summary() or az.plot_trace()\n\n\nNow, both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are defined as a function of a linear combination of the predictors.

Coefficients without the substring “psi” correspond to the \\(\\mu\\) parameter (the mean of the Poisson process) and are on the log scale. Coefficients with the substring “psi” correspond to the \\(\\psi\\) parameter (this can be thought of as the log-odds of non-zero data) and are on the logit scale. Interpreting these coefficients can be easier with the interpret sub-package.

One interpretation of this is that as the number of people in a group increases, the probability of catching no fish decreases.\n\n\nPosterior predictive distribution\nLastly, lets plot the posterior predictive distribution against the observed data to see how well the model fits the data.

    "text": "Hurdle poisson\nBoth ZIP and hurdle models both use two processes to generate data. The two models differ in their conceptualization of how the zeros are generated. In \\(\\text{ZIPoisson}\\), the zeroes can come from any of the processes, while in the hurdle Poisson they come only from one of the processes. Thus, a hurdle model assumes zero and positive values are generated from two independent processes. In the hurdle model, there are two components: (1) a “structural” process such as a binary model for modeling whether the response variable is zero or not, and (2) a process using a truncated model such as a truncated Poisson for modeling the counts. The result of these two components is a distribution that can be described as\n\\[P(Y=0) = 1 - \\psi\\]\n\\[P(Y=y_i) = \\psi \\frac{e^{-\\mu_i}\\mu_{i}^{y_i} / y_i!}{1 - e^{-\\mu_i}} \\ \\text{for} \\ y_i = 1, 2, 3,...,n\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) is the outcome, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the Poisson process where \\(\\mu \\ge 0\\), and \\(\\psi\\) is the probability of the Poisson process where \\(0 \\lt \\psi \\lt 1\\). The numerator of the second equation is the Poisson probability mass function, and the denominator is one minus the Poisson cumulative distribution function. This is a lot to digest. Again, let’s simulate some data to understand how data is generated from this process.\n\nx = np.arange(0, 22)\npsis = [0.7, 0.4]\nmus = [10, 4]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))\nfor psi, mu in zip(psis, mus):\n    pmf = stats.poisson.pmf(x, mu) # pmf evaluated at x given mu\n    cdf = stats.poisson.cdf(0, mu) # cdf evaluated at 0 given mu\n    pmf[0] = 1 - psi # 1.) generate zeros\n    pmf[1:] =  (psi * pmf[1:]) / (1 - cdf) # 2.) generate counts\n    pmf /= pmf.sum() # normalize to get probabilities\n    plt.plot(x, pmf, '-o', label='$\\\\psi$ = {}, $\\\\mu$ = {}'.format(psi, mu))\n\nplt.title(\"Hurdle Poisson Process\")\nplt.xlabel('x', fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel('f(x)', fontsize=12)\nplt.legend(loc=1)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe differences between the ZIP and hurdle models are subtle. Notice how in the code for the hurdle Poisson process, the zero counts are generate by (1 - psi) versus (1 - psi) + pmf[0] for the ZIP process. Additionally, the positive observations are generated by the process (psi * pmf[1:]) / (1 - cdf) where the numerator is a vector of probabilities for positive counts scaled by \\(\\psi\\) and the denominator uses the Poisson cumulative distribution function to evaluate the probability a count is greater than 0.\n\nHurdle regression model\nTo add predictors in the hurdle model, we follow the same specification as in the ZIP regression model section since both models have the same structure. The only difference is that the hurdle model uses a truncated Poisson distribution instead of a ZIP distribution. Right away, we will model both the parent and non-parent parameter as a function of the predictors.\n\nhurdle_formula = bmb.Formula(\n    \"count ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\", # parent parameter mu\n    \"psi ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\"    # non-parent parameter psi\n)\n\nhurdle_model = bmb.Model(\n    hurdle_formula, \n    fish_data, \n    family='hurdle_poisson'\n)\n\nhurdle_idata = hurdle_model.fit(\n    draws=1000, \n    target_accept=0.95, \n    random_seed=1234, \n    chains=4\n)\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [Intercept, livebait, camper, persons, child, psi_Intercept, psi_livebait, psi_camper, psi_persons, psi_child]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 6 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:06&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nhurdle_model\n\n       Formula: count ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\n                psi ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\n        Family: hurdle_poisson\n          Link: mu = log\n                psi = logit\n  Observations: 248\n        Priors: \n    target = mu\n        Common-level effects\n            Intercept ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 9.5283)\n            livebait ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 7.2685)\n            camper ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 5.0733)\n            persons ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 2.2583)\n            child ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 2.9419)\n    target = psi\n        Common-level effects\n            psi_Intercept ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n            psi_livebait ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n            psi_camper ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n            psi_persons ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n            psi_child ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 1.0)\n------\n* To see a plot of the priors call the .plot_priors() method.\n* To see a summary or plot of the posterior pass the object returned by .fit() to az.summary() or az.plot_trace()\n\n\n\nhurdle_model.graph()\n\n\n\n\nAs the same link functions are used for ZIP and Hurdle model, the coefficients can be interpreted in a similar manner.\n\naz.summary(\n    hurdle_idata,\n    var_names=[\"Intercept\", \"livebait\", \"camper\", \"persons\", \"child\"], \n    filter_vars=\"like\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n-1.615\n0.363\n-2.278\n-0.915\n0.006\n0.005\n3832.0\n2121.0\n1.0\n\n\nlivebait[1.0]\n1.661\n0.329\n1.031\n2.273\n0.005\n0.004\n4149.0\n1871.0\n1.0\n\n\ncamper[1.0]\n0.271\n0.100\n0.073\n0.449\n0.001\n0.001\n6843.0\n2934.0\n1.0\n\n\npersons\n0.610\n0.045\n0.533\n0.700\n0.001\n0.000\n4848.0\n3196.0\n1.0\n\n\nchild\n-0.791\n0.094\n-0.970\n-0.618\n0.001\n0.001\n4371.0\n3006.0\n1.0\n\n\npsi_Intercept\n-2.780\n0.583\n-3.906\n-1.715\n0.008\n0.006\n4929.0\n3258.0\n1.0\n\n\npsi_livebait[1.0]\n0.764\n0.427\n-0.067\n1.557\n0.006\n0.005\n5721.0\n2779.0\n1.0\n\n\npsi_camper[1.0]\n0.849\n0.298\n0.283\n1.378\n0.004\n0.003\n5523.0\n2855.0\n1.0\n\n\npsi_persons\n1.040\n0.183\n0.719\n1.396\n0.003\n0.002\n3852.0\n3007.0\n1.0\n\n\npsi_child\n-2.003\n0.282\n-2.555\n-1.517\n0.004\n0.003\n4021.0\n3183.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior predictive samples\nAs with the ZIP model above, we plot the posterior predictive distribution against the observed data to see how well the model fits the data.\n\nhurdle_pps = hurdle_model.predict(idata=hurdle_idata, kind=\"pps\", inplace=False)\n\nbins = np.arange(39)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 3))\nax = plot_ppc_discrete(hurdle_pps, bins, ax)\nax.set_xlabel(\"Number of Fish Caught\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\nax.set_title(\"Hurdle Model - Posterior Predictive Distribution\");\n\n\n\n\nThe plot looks similar to the ZIP model above.

    "text": "Summary\nIn this notebook, two classes of models (ZIP and hurdle Poisson) for modeling zero-inflated data were presented and implemented in Bambi. The difference of the data generating process between the two models differ in how zeros are generated. The ZIP model uses a distribution that mixes two data generating processes. The first process generates zeros, and the second process uses a Poisson distribution to generate counts (of which some may be zero). The hurdle Poisson also uses two data generating processes, but doesn’t “mix” them. A process is used for generating zeros such as a binary model for modeling whether the response variable is zero or not, and a second process for modeling the counts. These two proceses are independent of each other.\nThe dataset used to demonstrate the two models had a large number of zeros. These zeros appeared because the group doesn’t fish, or because they fished, but caught zero fish. Because zeros could be generated due to two different reasons, the ZIP model, which allows zeros to be generated from a mixture of processes, seems to be more appropriate for this datset.\n\n%load_ext watermark\n%watermark -n -u -v -iv -w\n\nLast updated: Mon Sep 25 2023\n\nPython implementation: CPython\nPython version       : 3.11.0\nIPython version      : 8.13.2\n\nseaborn   : 0.12.2\nnumpy     : 1.24.2\nscipy     : 1.11.2\nbambi     : 0.13.0.dev0\nmatplotlib: 3.7.1\narviz     : 0.16.1\npandas    : 2.1.0\n\nWatermark: 2.3.1"

    "title": "Inference - Gibbs Sampling from Scratch",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A variant of the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm that uses clever proposals and is therefore more efficient (you can get a good approximate of the posterior with far fewer samples) is Gibbs sampling. A problem with MH is the need to choose the proposal distribution, and the fact that the acceptance rate may be low.\nThe improvement arises from adaptive proposals in which the distribution of proposed parameter values adjusts itself intelligently, depending upon the parameter values at the moment. This dependence upon the parameters at that moment is an exploitation of conditional independence properties of a graphical model to automatically create a good proposal, with acceptance probability equal to one.\n\nMain Idea\nSuppose we have a 3-dimensional joint distribution. Estimating this joint distribution is much harder than a 1-dimensional distribution. Subsequently, sampling is also harder in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). In Gibbs sampling, you condition each variable on the values of all the other variables in the distribution. For example, if we have \\(D=3\\) variables:\n\\[x_{1}^{s+1} \\sim p(x_1 | x_2^s,x_3^s)\\]\n\\[x_{2}^{s+1} \\sim p(x_2 | x_1^{s+1},x_3^s)\\]\n\\[x_{3}^{s+1} \\sim p(x_3 | x_1^{s+1},x_2^{s+1})\\]\nwhere \\(x_1, x_2,...,x_n\\) are variable \\(1, 2,...,n\\), respectively. By conditioning on the values of the other variables, sampling from the conditional distribution is much easier than the joint. Because of the exploitation of conditional independence properties of graphical models, the Gibbs algorithm can readily generalize to \\(D\\) variables.\n\n\nGibbs Sampling - Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model\nHere, the Gibbs sampling algorithm is implemented in PyTorch for a 2-dimensional Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The Bayesian GMM is given by:\n\\[p(z = k, x | \\theta) = \\pi_k \\mathcal{N}(x|\\mu_k, \\sum_k)\\]\nwhere the parameters \\(\\theta\\) are known and implemented using PyTorch’s MixtureSameFamily distribution class. This class implements a batch of mixture distributions where all components are from different parameterizations of the same distribution type (Normal distributions in this example). It is then parameterized by a Categorical distribution over \\(k\\) components.\nFor a GMM, the full conditional distributions are:\n\\[p(x|z = k, \\theta) = \\mathcal{N}(x|\\mu_k, \\sum_k)\\]\nThis conditional distribution reads; “the probability of data \\(x\\) given component \\(k\\) parameterized by \\(\\theta\\) is distributed according to a Normal distribution with a mean vector \\(\\mu\\) and covariance \\(\\sum\\) according to component \\(k\\)”.\n\\[p(z = k | x) = \\frac{\\pi_k \\mathcal{N}(x|\\mu_k, \\sum_k)}{\\sum_{k'} \\mathcal{N}(x|\\mu_{k'}, \\sum_{k'})}\\]\nThis conditional distribution is given by Bayes rule and reads; “the probability of component \\(k\\) given we observe some data \\(x\\) is equal to the prior probability \\(\\pi\\) of component \\(k\\) times the likelihood of data \\(x\\) being distributed according to a Normal distribution with a mean vector \\(\\mu\\) and covariance \\(\\sum\\) according to component \\(k\\)” over the total probability of components \\(k\\).\nWith the conditional distributions defined, the Gibbs sampling algorithm can be implemented.

To analyze the trace history of the sampler, x_samples and z_samples are empty lists.\nIn the for loop, the conditional \\(p(z = k \\vert x)\\) is computed using x_current, i.e., given we have observed datum \\(x\\), what is the log probability of component \\(Z = k\\).\nprobs_z is then multiplied by the prior probability of the mixture components.\nThen, the denominator for the conditional \\(p(z = k \\vert x)\\) is computed by dividing probs_z by the total probability.\nSince there are only two components in this GMM, we use logic to determine which component is most likely with the x_current. As zero-based indexing is used, the components are \\(k = 0, 1\\). Therefore, if the probability of \\(k=1 &gt; k=0\\), then use index\\(=1\\), else index\\(=0\\).\nz_current defines the component using zero-based indexing. Thus, indexing mu and scale by the current, most likely component, new samples are drawn according to the conditional Normal distribution.\nData and component samples are appended for analyzing the trace history.\n\n\n\nLimitations\nAlthough Gibbs sampling can generalize to \\(D\\) variables, the algorithm becomes inefficient as it tends to get stuck in small regions of the posterior for, potentially, a long number of iterations. This isn’t because of the large number of variables, but rather, because models with many parameters tend to have regions of high correlation in the posterior. High correlation between parameters means a narrow ridge of probability combinations, resulting in the sampler getting “stuck”."

    "text": "Initializing the kernel\nFirst, we initialize the NUTS kernel with the model. The word kernel is used in a wide range of fields ranging from probabilistic programming, statistics, and deep learning. In PPLs, the name kernel is typically used to define the interface with the sampling algorithm. In this case, we have initialized a NUTS kernel with our model, and this kernel will allow us to interface our model with the underlying HMC sampling variant NUTS.\nBut, the sampling algorithm can’t simply interface with a Python function. Our model, in the form of a Python function, needs to be translated into a joint log density function and used as input into the sampler. Here, this is where NumPyro performs a series of steps to perform this translation.\nWhen we “feed” the model into the NUTS class an initialize_model utility function is called. This function calls various helper functions such as get_potential_fn and find_valid_initial_params to return a tuple of (init_params_info, potential_fn, postprocess_fn, model_trace). Here, we are interested in initialize_model and get_potential_fn.\nThe graph of function calls looks like: initialize model \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) get potential fn \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) potential energy \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) log density where each function being called is also returning an object. Below, the sequential order of functions calls are described."

    "section": "Probability of feasibility",
    "text": "Probability of feasibility\nIn BoTorch it is common to use a Gaussian Process (GP) to model the objective function. The output of the GP is a Gaussian distribution over the predicted values for a given set of input points. It provides not just a single point estimate but a probabilistic prediction that accounts for uncertainty in the predictions. Thus, for each point in the search space, we have a corresponding Gaussian distribution representing the belief of the objective value at that point.\nIntuitively, if we have defined an outcome constraint, we can compute the probability that \\(f(x)\\) is feasible by taking the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the predictive distribution and computing the area between the lower bound and the upper bound. For example, imagine a GP has made a prediction given an input \\(x\\). This predictive distribution of the outcome \\(y\\) is shown below. The prediction is normally distributed around \\(0.0\\) with plausible predictions ranging from \\(-3\\) to \\(3\\).

    "title": "Survival Models in Bambi",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Survival models, also known as time-to-event models, are specialized statistical methods designed to analyze the time until the occurrence of an event of interest. In this notebook, a review of survival analysis (using non-parametric and parametric methods) and censored data is provided, followed by a survival model implementation in Bambi.\nThis blog post is a copy of the survival models documentation I wrote for Bambi. The original post can be found here.\n\n\nSometimes the right way to model discrete, countable events is to model not the counts themselves but rather the time between events. This gives us information regarding the rate of an event. Survival models are models for countable things, but the outcomes we want to predict are durations. Durations are continuous deviations from some point of reference (so they are all positive values).\nThe tricky part with survival models is not the probability distribution assigned to the durations, but dealing with censoring. Censoring occurs when the event of interest does not occur in the window of observation. In a simple scenario, this can happen because the observation period ends before the event occurred. Censored individuals (or units) can not just be dropped from the sample. As an example, we use Richard McElreath’s cat adoption example from chapter 11.4 of Statistical Rethinking: Imagine a cohort of 100 cats who start waiting for adoption at the same time. After one month, half of them have been adopted. Now what is the rate of adoption? You can’t compute it using only the cats who have been adopted. You need to also account for the cats who haven’t yet been adopted. The cats who haven’t been adopted yet, but eventually will be adopted, clearly have longer waiting times than the cats who have already been adopted. So the average rate among those who are already adopted is biased upwards—it is confounded by conditioning on adoption.\nIncluding censored observations requires a new type of model. The key idea is that the same distribution assumption for the outcome tells us both the probability of any observed duration that end in the event as well as the probability that we would wait the observed duration without seeing the event. For each unit, we assume there is a true survival time \\(T\\) as well as a true censoring time \\(C\\). The survival time represents the time at which the event of interest occurs. The censoring time is the time at which censoring occurs. We observe either: the survival, or the censoring time:\n\\[Y = \\text{min}(T, C)\\]\nIf the event occurs, then we observe the survival time, else we observe the censoring time. In order to analyze survival data, we first need to understand the two types of censoring: left and right censoring, and how to estimate the survival function.\n\n\n\nThere are two main “types” of censoring: right and left. Right censoring occurs when \\(T \\ge Y\\), i.e. the true event time \\(T\\) is at least as large as the observed time \\(Y\\). This is a consequence of \\(Y = \\text{min}(T, C)\\). Right censoring derives its name from the notion that time is typically read and displayed from left to right. Left sensoring occurs when the true event time \\(T\\) is less than or equal to the observed time \\(Y\\). An example of left censoring could be in a study of pregnancy duration. Suppose that patients are surveyed 250 days (8.2 months) after conception. Some patients may have already had their babies. For these patients, pregnancy duration is less than 250 days.\n\n\n\nSurvival analysis is concerned with estimating the survival function \\(S(t)\\)\n\\[S(t) = Pr(T &gt; t) = 1 - F(t)\\]\nwhich is a decreasing function that quantifies the probability of surviving past time \\(t\\). Alternatively, \\(S(t)\\) can be expressed as one minus the cumulative distribution function (CDF) \\(F\\) of the event time \\(T\\)—referred to as the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF). The focus on the survival function is important because for censored observations, we only know that the time-to-event exceeds the observed time \\(Y\\).\nHere, continuing with the cat adoption example, we consider the task of estimating the survival function for cat adoptions. To estimate \\(S(30) = Pr(T &gt; 30)\\), the probability that a cat is not adopted after 30 days, it is tempting to compute the proportion of cats who were adopted before 30 days and subtract this from 1. However, this would be incorrect because it ignores the cats who were not adopted before 30 days but who will be adopted later—these cats clearly have longer adoption rates. Thus, if we continued with the naive approach, the average rate of adoption would be biased upwards—it is confounded by conditioning on adoption.\nHowever, it is possible to overcome this challenge by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric estimator of the survival function that accounts for censoring. Let \\(d_1 &lt; d_2 &lt; . . . &lt; d_K\\) denote the \\(K\\) unique adoption times among the non-censored cats, and \\(q_k\\) denote the number of cats adopted at time \\(d_k\\). For \\(k = 1,...,K\\), let \\(r_k\\) denote the number of cats not adopted at time \\(d_k\\). By the law of total probability\n\\[Pr(T &gt; d_k) = Pr(T &gt; d_k | T &gt; d_{k-1}) Pr(T &gt; d_{k-1}) + Pr(T &gt; d_k | T \\leq d_{k-1}) Pr(T \\leq d_{k-1})\\]\nThe fact that \\(d_{k-1} &lt; d_k\\) implies that \\(Pr(T &gt; d_k | T \\leq d_{k-1}) = 0\\) (as it is impossible for a cat to be adopted past time \\(d_k\\) if the cat was adopted before time \\(d_{k-1}\\)). Thus, if we simplify the above equation and plug into the survival function, we obtain\n\\[S(d_k) = Pr(T &gt; d_k | T &gt; d_{k-1})S(d_{k-1})\\]\nNow we must estimate the terms on the right-hand side. It is common to use the following estimator\n\\[\\hat{Pr}(T &gt; d_j | T &gt; d_{j-1}) = \\frac{r_j - q_j}{r_j}\\]\nwhich leads us to the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function\n\\[\\hat{S}(d_k) = \\prod_{j=1}^k \\frac{r_j - q_j}{r_j}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{S}(d_k)\\) represents the estimated survival probability up to time \\(d_k\\). The product is taken over all time points up to \\(k\\), where an event occurred. The variables \\(r_j\\) and \\(q_j\\) denote the number of subjects at risk and the number of events at time \\(d_j\\), respectively. The term \\(\\frac{r_j - q_j}{r_j}\\) is the conditional probability of surviving the \\(j\\)-th time point given that an individual has survived just before \\(d_j\\). Specifically, \\(r_j - q_j\\) are the number of individuals who survived just before \\(d_j\\) and \\(r_j\\) is the number of individuals who survived just after \\(d_j\\), and \\(r_j\\) are those who were at risk \\(d_j\\).\n\n\nBelow we use the KaplanMeierFitter class of the lifelines package to compute and visualize the survival curve for cat adoptions from an animal shelter in Austin, Texas beginning October 1st, 2013 until May 30th, 2018 (the last day the shelter rescued a cat). The dataset comes from the City of Austin Open Data Portal and contains columns such as animal name, date of birth, species, and many more. However, for the purpose of this notebook we are interested in the following columns: - days_to_event - number of days until the cat was adopted (date_in - date_out) - out_event - the reason for the cat leaving this particular shelter, e.g. adopted or transfered. - color - the color of the cat, e.g. white, blue, brown tabby, black.\n\n\nCode\nimport arviz as az\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport scipy\n\nfrom lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter\n\nimport bambi as bmb\n\n\n\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/master/data/AustinCats.csv\"\ncats_df = pd.read_csv(url, sep=\";\")\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))\nplt.hist(cats_df[\"days_to_event\"], bins=250, label=\"Uncensored data\")\nplt.xlim(0, 186) # limit to 6 months for visibility\nplt.title(\"Days Until Adoption\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Count\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Days\")\nplt.legend();\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of days until adoption exhibits a long tail with most cats (if we observe the adopt event) being adopted within the first month of inception. Note that the plot has been truncated to six months for better visibility. Below, we estimate the survival function using the KaplanMeierFitter class from the lifelines package.\n\nkm = KaplanMeierFitter()\nkm_adoptions = km.fit(\n    cats_df[\"days_to_event\"], \n    cats_df[\"out_event\"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == \"Adoption\" else 0)\n)\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 3))\nkm_adoptions.plot(label=\"Kaplan-Meier Estimator\", ax=ax)\nax.set_ylabel(\"Probability of Adoption\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Days\")\nax.set_xlim(0, 365)\nax.grid(True)\nax.set_title(\"Cat Adoption Survival Curve\");\n\n\n\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator shows that by 100 days, the probability of a cat not being adopted is about \\(0.15\\) percent. After 100 days, the probability of cat not being adopted decreases, albeit at a much slower rate. Thus, if a cat hasn’t been adopted by the 100th day, it is more likely the cat will continue to wait for adoption. In the next section, we discuss pm.Censored, a PyMC distrbution that allows us to model censored data.\n\n\n\n\nThe censored distribution from PyMC allows us to make use of a sequential construction, similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimator outlined above, to model censored data. To understand the pm.Censored distribution, lets reason how a distribution may be used to model censored data. For observed adoptions, the probability of observed waiting time can be distributed according to an exponential with some rate \\(\\lambda\\) \\[D_i \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\lambda_i)\\] or \\[f(D_i | \\lambda_i) = \\lambda_i \\text{exp}(-\\lambda_i D_i)\\] It’s the censored cats that are tricky. If something else happened before a cat could be adopted, or it simply hasn’t been adopted yet, then we need the probability of not being adopted, conditional on the observation time so far. One way to motivate this is to image a cohort of 100 cats, all joining the shelter on the same day. - If half have been adopted after 30 days, then the probability of waiting 30 days and still not being adopted is 0.5. - If after 60 days, only 25 remain, then the probability of waiting 60 days and not yet being adopted is 0.25.\nThus, any given rate of adoption implies a proportion of the cohort of 100 cats that will remain after any given number of days. This probability comes from the cumulative probability distribution. A cumulative distribution gives the proportion of cats adopted before or at a certain number of days. So \\(1 - \\text{CDF}\\), which is the CCDF, gives the probability a cat is not adopted by the same number of days. Remember from the Estimating the survival function section, this is equivalent to the survival function. If the exponential distribution is used, the CDF is\n\\[F(D_i | \\lambda_i) = 1 - \\text{exp}(-\\lambda_i D_i)\\]\nwhere the complement is (here we use \\(S\\) to denote the equivalence of the survival function and CCDF)\n\\[S(D_i|\\lambda) = \\text{exp}(-\\lambda_i D_i)\\]\nWhich is what we need in our model since it is the probability of waiting \\(D_i\\) days without being adopted yet. The pm.Censored from PyMC offers a convenient way to model censored data and the probability density function (PDF) is defined as\n\\[\\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{for } x &lt; \\text{lower}, \\\\\n\\text{CDF}(\\text{lower}, \\text{dist}) & \\text{for } x = \\text{lower}, \\\\\n\\text{PDF}(x, \\text{dist}) & \\text{for } \\text{lower} &lt; x &lt; \\text{upper}, \\\\\n1 - \\text{CDF}(\\text{upper}, \\text{dist}) & \\text{for } x = \\text{upper}, \\\\\n0 & \\text{for } x &gt; \\text{upper}.\n\\end{cases}\\]\nwhere lower is left-censored and upper is right-censored. Our cat adoption dataset is right-censored. Therefore, lower can be None, and upper is the observed times when an event occurs. The pm.Censored uses the CCDF to answer the question we are interested in: what is the probability of not being adopted yet, given the observation time so far?\n\n\nTo understand how this is used, lets use Bambi to recover the parameters of the censored distribution with no predictors. Before the model is fit, days_to_event is scaled to represent months as the raw values contain very large values. This scaling ensures a smoother sampling process.\nAdditionally, modeling censored data in Bambi requires a new formula syntax censored(time, event) on the response term. censored indicates we want to model censored data and gets parsed where time and event are passed into a Bambi transformation function censored. This function takes two arguments: the first being the observed value \\(Y\\) (in this example time), and the second being the type of censoring of the event. In Bambi, it is possible to have left, none, right, and interval censoring. event needs to be encoded as one of the censoring types. In our cat adoption example, we will encode the adoption event as right.\nLastly, the exponential distribution is used to model the cat adoption rate parameter. But why not enter censored as the likelihood like we normally do in Bambi? The pm.Censored is indeed eventually used as the likelihood. However, there also needs to be a distribution that models the rate parameter. In this example it is the exponential distribution. This distribution is then used as input into the pm.Censored distribution. For more information on how to use the pm.Censored distribution, see the following PyMC documentation: Bayesian regression models with truncated and censored data and Censored data models.\n\ncats = cats_df.copy()\ncats[\"adopt\"] = np.where(cats[\"out_event\"] == \"Adoption\", \"right\", \"none\")\ncats[\"color_id\"] = np.where(cats[\"color\"] == \"Black\", 1, 0)\ncats = cats[[\"days_to_event\", \"adopt\", \"color_id\"]]\n\n\nmodel_1 = bmb.Model(\n    \"censored(days_to_event / 31, adopt) ~ 1\", \n    data=cats,\n    family=\"exponential\",\n    link=\"log\"\n)\nmodel_1.build()\nmodel_1.graph()\n\n\n\n\n\nidata_1 = model_1.fit(\n    tune=500,\n    draws=500,\n    random_seed=42, \n    chains=4, \n    cores=10\n)\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 10 jobs)\nNUTS: [Intercept]\nSampling 4 chains for 500 tune and 500 draw iterations (2_000 + 2_000 draws total) took 5 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [4000/4000 00:05&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\naz.plot_trace(idata_1);\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary = az.summary(idata_1)\nsummary\n\n/Users/gabestechschulte/miniforge3/envs/bambinos/lib/python3.11/site-packages/xarray/core/concat.py:546: FutureWarning: unique with argument that is not not a Series, Index, ExtensionArray, or np.ndarray is deprecated and will raise in a future version.\n  common_dims = tuple(pd.unique([d for v in vars for d in v.dims]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n0.501\n0.01\n0.483\n0.52\n0.0\n0.0\n801.0\n1099.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the intercept (the cat adoption rate parameter) alone is of not much value. Therefore, lets use the survival function to compute the probability of not being adopted after a range of months, given the learned rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\). We could dervive the survival function and pass the intercept parameter to it, but SciPy already implements it as scipy.stats.expon.sf, so we will just use this implementation.\n\n\n\nThe plot below shows the estimated survival function and CCDF for cat adoptions. First, we compute the \\(0.95\\) credible interval (CI) and median value for the intercept. Then, since a log-link was used, the values are exponentiated.\n\nlambda_preds = np.quantile(\n    idata_1[\"posterior\"][\"Intercept\"], \n    [0.025, 0.5, 0.975]\n)\n\nlambda_lower = 1 / np.exp(lambda_preds[0])\nlambda_median = 1 / np.exp(lambda_preds[1])\nlambda_upper = 1 / np.exp(lambda_preds[2])\n\n\nt = np.linspace(0, max(cats[\"days_to_event\"] / 31), 100)\nS0 = scipy.stats.expon.sf\ncdf = scipy.stats.expon.cdf\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 3), sharey=True)\n\nax[0].plot(t, S0(lambda_median * t))\nax[0].fill_between(t, S0(lambda_lower * t), S0(lambda_upper * t), alpha=0.25)\nax[0].grid(True)\nax[0].set_xlim(0, 12)\nax[0].set_xlabel(\"Months\")\nax[0].set_ylabel(\"Probability\")\nax[0].set_title(\"Probability Not Being Adopted by Time $d_k$\")\n\nax[1].plot(t, cdf(lambda_median * t))\nax[1].fill_between(t, cdf(lambda_lower * t), cdf(lambda_upper * t), alpha=0.25)\nax[1].grid(True)\nax[1].vlines(1, 1, 1, linestyles=\"dashed\")\nax[1].set_xlabel(\"Months\")\nax[1].set_ylabel(\"Probability\")\nax[1].set_title(\"Probability of Being Adopted by Time $d_k$\");\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the CCDF (the left plot), the probability of a cat waiting one month without being adopted is about \\(0.60\\), whereas the probability of a cat being adopted by the first month is about \\(0.40\\). Analyzing the CDF (right plot), the majority of cats, about \\(0.97\\), are adopted by the sixth month. Now that we have an intuition on how pm.Censored is used for modeling censored data, in the next section, we will discuss how to model censored data with predictors.\n\n\n\n\nIt is often the case that we would like to understand how various predictors are associated with the survival function. For example, we may want to know if the survival function for cats of different colors or species is different. As outlined above, we cannot simply run a regression on the observed times \\(Y\\) given some predictors \\(X\\). What we are actually interested in is predicting the survival time \\(T\\) given the predictors \\(X\\). To achieve this, we first need to understand the Hazard function and the Cox proportional hazards model.\n\n\nIn survival analysis, it is often more convenient to express the survival function in terms of the hazards rate, which is closely related to the survival function \\(S(t)\\), and is the instantaneous rate of an event occuring at time \\(t\\) given that the event has not yet occured.\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{align*}\n\\lambda(t)\n    & = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{P(t &lt; T &lt; t + \\Delta t\\ |\\ T &gt; t) / \\Delta t}{Pr(T &gt; t)} \\\\\n    & = \\lim_{{\\Delta t \\to 0}} \\frac{Pr(t &lt; T \\leq t + \\Delta t) / \\Delta t}{Pr(T &gt; t)} \\\\\n    & = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\n\\end{align*}\\end{split}\\]\nwhere\n\\[f(t) = \\lim_{{\\Delta t \\to 0}} \\frac{Pr(t &lt; T \\leq t + \\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the (unobserved) survival time and \\(f(t)\\) is the PDF associated with \\(T\\). The relationship between the hazard function and the survival function can be described in terms of the likelihood \\(L\\)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nL_i =\n\\begin{cases}\nf(y_i) & \\text{if the } i\\text{th observation is not censored} \\\\\nS(y_i) & \\text{if the } i\\text{th observation is censored}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIf \\(Y = y_i\\) and the \\(i\\text{th}\\) observation is not censored, then the likelihood is the probability of the event in a tiny interval around time \\(y_i\\). If the \\(i\\text{th}\\) observation is censored, then the likelihood is the probability of surviving at least until time \\(y_i\\). We have now seen two ways to model the survival times: (1) a non-parametric estimator such as Kaplan-Meier, and (2) a parametric model using the PDF \\(f(t)\\) to estimate the hazard rate. However, what we would really like to do is to model the survival time as a function of the predictors. Thus, instead of working with the PDF \\(f(t)\\), we work directly with the hazard function to model the survival time as a function of predictors.\n\n\n\nAbove, we developed a model with no predictors to recover the parameters of the cat adoption rate, and used this as input into the pm.Censored distribution. Since we would now like to add predictor(s), we need to reformulate our modeling task into a risk regression model as it allows us to model the hazard rate as a function of our predictors. Specifically, the Cox proportional hazards model. With predictors \\(x_j\\) and regression coefficients \\(\\beta\\), the hazard rate is modeled as\n\\[\\lambda(t|x_i) = \\lambda_0(t)\\text{exp}(\\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}\\beta_j)\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda_{0}t\\) is the baseline hazard rate independent of the predictors. This baseline hazard rate is unspecified (or unidentified) and means that we allow the instantaneous probability of an event at time \\(t\\), given that a subject has survived at least until time \\(t\\), to take any form. Practically speaking, this means that the hazard function is very flexible and can model a wide range of relationships between the covariates and survival time. One can interpret the Cox proportional hazards model as a one-unit increase in \\(x_{ij}\\) corresponds to an increase in \\(\\lambda(t, x_i)\\) by a factor of \\(\\text{exp}(\\beta_j)\\). In the next section, it is discussed how to develop a regression model with survival responses and predictors.\n\n\n\n\nAdding predictors to model the hazard rate as a function of our predictors is trivial in Bambi. We simply continue to use the formula syntax. In the backend, the rate is modeled as a function of the specified predictors in the Bambi model. For example, if in the Bambi model, we specified censored(y, event) ~ 1 + x with an exponential likelihood, then the latent rate \\(\\lambda\\) is modeled as an exponential distribution according to\n\\[\\alpha \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\] \\[\\beta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\] \\[\\mu = \\text{exp}(\\alpha + \\beta X)\\] \\[\\lambda = 1 / \\mu\\] \\[Y \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\lambda)\\]\nwhere \\(Y\\) is then passed to the dist argument of the pm.Censored distribution.\n\n\nHowever, thanks to Bambi’s formula syntax, we can just include the predictors of interest. Below, color_id is added to model the survival probability of black and other colored cats.\n\ncat_model = bmb.Model(\n    \"censored(days_to_event / 31, adopt) ~ 0 + color_id\", \n    data=cats,\n    center_predictors=False,\n    priors={\"color_id\": bmb.Prior(\"Normal\", mu=0, sigma=1)},\n    categorical=[\"color_id\"],\n    family=\"exponential\",\n    link=\"log\"\n)\ncat_model.build()\ncat_model.graph()\n\n/Users/gabestechschulte/miniforge3/envs/bambinos/lib/python3.11/site-packages/formulae/terms/variable.py:87: FutureWarning: is_categorical_dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

First, the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator to estimate the survival curve of censored data was introduced. Subsequently, motivated by modeling the survival function as a function of predictors, the hazards rate and Cox proportional hazards model was introduced. Modeling censored data in Bambi requires defining the response as censored(y, event) where event is left or right censoring. To add predictors to the model, simply include them in the formula.

    "text": "Sometimes the right way to model discrete, countable events is to model not the counts themselves but rather the time between events. This gives us information regarding the rate of an event. Survival models are models for countable things, but the outcomes we want to predict are durations. Durations are continuous deviations from some point of reference (so they are all positive values).\nThe tricky part with survival models is not the probability distribution assigned to the durations, but dealing with censoring. Censoring occurs when the event of interest does not occur in the window of observation. In a simple scenario, this can happen because the observation period ends before the event occurred. Censored individuals (or units) can not just be dropped from the sample. As an example, we use Richard McElreath’s cat adoption example from chapter 11.4 of Statistical Rethinking: Imagine a cohort of 100 cats who start waiting for adoption at the same time. After one month, half of them have been adopted. Now what is the rate of adoption? You can’t compute it using only the cats who have been adopted. You need to also account for the cats who haven’t yet been adopted. The cats who haven’t been adopted yet, but eventually will be adopted, clearly have longer waiting times than the cats who have already been adopted. So the average rate among those who are already adopted is biased upwards—it is confounded by conditioning on adoption.\nIncluding censored observations requires a new type of model. The key idea is that the same distribution assumption for the outcome tells us both the probability of any observed duration that end in the event as well as the probability that we would wait the observed duration without seeing the event. For each unit, we assume there is a true survival time \\(T\\) as well as a true censoring time \\(C\\). The survival time represents the time at which the event of interest occurs. The censoring time is the time at which censoring occurs. We observe either: the survival, or the censoring time:\n\\[Y = \\text{min}(T, C)\\]\nIf the event occurs, then we observe the survival time, else we observe the censoring time. In order to analyze survival data, we first need to understand the two types of censoring: left and right censoring, and how to estimate the survival function."

This is a consequence of \\(Y = \\text{min}(T, C)\\). Right censoring derives its name from the notion that time is typically read and displayed from left to right. Left sensoring occurs when the true event time \\(T\\) is less than or equal to the observed time \\(Y\\). An example of left censoring could be in a study of pregnancy duration. Suppose that patients are surveyed 250 days (8.2 months) after conception. Some patients may have already had their babies. For these patients, pregnancy duration is less than 250 days."

    "text": "Survival analysis is concerned with estimating the survival function \\(S(t)\\)\n\\[S(t) = Pr(T &gt; t) = 1 - F(t)\\]\nwhich is a decreasing function that quantifies the probability of surviving past time \\(t\\). Alternatively, \\(S(t)\\) can be expressed as one minus the cumulative distribution function (CDF) \\(F\\) of the event time \\(T\\)—referred to as the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF). The focus on the survival function is important because for censored observations, we only know that the time-to-event exceeds the observed time \\(Y\\).\nHere, continuing with the cat adoption example, we consider the task of estimating the survival function for cat adoptions. To estimate \\(S(30) = Pr(T &gt; 30)\\), the probability that a cat is not adopted after 30 days, it is tempting to compute the proportion of cats who were adopted before 30 days and subtract this from 1. However, this would be incorrect because it ignores the cats who were not adopted before 30 days but who will be adopted later—these cats clearly have longer adoption rates. Thus, if we continued with the naive approach, the average rate of adoption would be biased upwards—it is confounded by conditioning on adoption.\nHowever, it is possible to overcome this challenge by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric estimator of the survival function that accounts for censoring. Let \\(d_1 &lt; d_2 &lt; . . . &lt; d_K\\) denote the \\(K\\) unique adoption times among the non-censored cats, and \\(q_k\\) denote the number of cats adopted at time \\(d_k\\). For \\(k = 1,...,K\\), let \\(r_k\\) denote the number of cats not adopted at time \\(d_k\\). By the law of total probability\n\\[Pr(T &gt; d_k) = Pr(T &gt; d_k | T &gt; d_{k-1}) Pr(T &gt; d_{k-1}) + Pr(T &gt; d_k | T \\leq d_{k-1}) Pr(T \\leq d_{k-1})\\]\nThe fact that \\(d_{k-1} &lt; d_k\\) implies that \\(Pr(T &gt; d_k | T \\leq d_{k-1}) = 0\\) (as it is impossible for a cat to be adopted past time \\(d_k\\) if the cat was adopted before time \\(d_{k-1}\\)). Thus, if we simplify the above equation and plug into the survival function, we obtain\n\\[S(d_k) = Pr(T &gt; d_k | T &gt; d_{k-1})S(d_{k-1})\\]\nNow we must estimate the terms on the right-hand side. It is common to use the following estimator\n\\[\\hat{Pr}(T &gt; d_j | T &gt; d_{j-1}) = \\frac{r_j - q_j}{r_j}\\]\nwhich leads us to the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function\n\\[\\hat{S}(d_k) = \\prod_{j=1}^k \\frac{r_j - q_j}{r_j}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{S}(d_k)\\) represents the estimated survival probability up to time \\(d_k\\). The product is taken over all time points up to \\(k\\), where an event occurred. The variables \\(r_j\\) and \\(q_j\\) denote the number of subjects at risk and the number of events at time \\(d_j\\), respectively. The term \\(\\frac{r_j - q_j}{r_j}\\) is the conditional probability of surviving the \\(j\\)-th time point given that an individual has survived just before \\(d_j\\). Specifically, \\(r_j - q_j\\) are the number of individuals who survived just before \\(d_j\\) and \\(r_j\\) is the number of individuals who survived just after \\(d_j\\), and \\(r_j\\) are those who were at risk \\(d_j\\).\n\n\nBelow we use the KaplanMeierFitter class of the lifelines package to compute and visualize the survival curve for cat adoptions from an animal shelter in Austin, Texas beginning October 1st, 2013 until May 30th, 2018 (the last day the shelter rescued a cat). The dataset comes from the City of Austin Open Data Portal and contains columns such as animal name, date of birth, species, and many more. However, for the purpose of this notebook we are interested in the following columns: - days_to_event - number of days until the cat was adopted (date_in - date_out) - out_event - the reason for the cat leaving this particular shelter, e.g. adopted or transfered. - color - the color of the cat, e.g. white, blue, brown tabby, black.\n\n\nCode\nimport arviz as az\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport scipy\n\nfrom lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter\n\nimport bambi as bmb\n\n\n\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/master/data/AustinCats.csv\"\ncats_df = pd.read_csv(url, sep=\";\")\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))\nplt.hist(cats_df[\"days_to_event\"], bins=250, label=\"Uncensored data\")\nplt.xlim(0, 186) # limit to 6 months for visibility\nplt.title(\"Days Until Adoption\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Count\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Days\")\nplt.legend();\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of days until adoption exhibits a long tail with most cats (if we observe the adopt event) being adopted within the first month of inception. Note that the plot has been truncated to six months for better visibility. Below, we estimate the survival function using the KaplanMeierFitter class from the lifelines package.\n\nkm = KaplanMeierFitter()\nkm_adoptions = km.fit(\n    cats_df[\"days_to_event\"], \n    cats_df[\"out_event\"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == \"Adoption\" else 0)\n)\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 3))\nkm_adoptions.plot(label=\"Kaplan-Meier Estimator\", ax=ax)\nax.set_ylabel(\"Probability of Adoption\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Days\")\nax.set_xlim(0, 365)\nax.grid(True)\nax.set_title(\"Cat Adoption Survival Curve\");\n\n\n\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator shows that by 100 days, the probability of a cat not being adopted is about \\(0.15\\) percent. After 100 days, the probability of cat not being adopted decreases, albeit at a much slower rate. Thus, if a cat hasn’t been adopted by the 100th day, it is more likely the cat will continue to wait for adoption. In the next section, we discuss pm.Censored, a PyMC distrbution that allows us to model censored data."

    "text": "The censored distribution from PyMC allows us to make use of a sequential construction, similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimator outlined above, to model censored data. To understand the pm.Censored distribution, lets reason how a distribution may be used to model censored data. For observed adoptions, the probability of observed waiting time can be distributed according to an exponential with some rate \\(\\lambda\\) \\[D_i \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\lambda_i)\\] or \\[f(D_i | \\lambda_i) = \\lambda_i \\text{exp}(-\\lambda_i D_i)\\] It’s the censored cats that are tricky. If something else happened before a cat could be adopted, or it simply hasn’t been adopted yet, then we need the probability of not being adopted, conditional on the observation time so far. One way to motivate this is to image a cohort of 100 cats, all joining the shelter on the same day. - If half have been adopted after 30 days, then the probability of waiting 30 days and still not being adopted is 0.5. - If after 60 days, only 25 remain, then the probability of waiting 60 days and not yet being adopted is 0.25.\nThus, any given rate of adoption implies a proportion of the cohort of 100 cats that will remain after any given number of days. This probability comes from the cumulative probability distribution. A cumulative distribution gives the proportion of cats adopted before or at a certain number of days. So \\(1 - \\text{CDF}\\), which is the CCDF, gives the probability a cat is not adopted by the same number of days. Remember from the Estimating the survival function section, this is equivalent to the survival function. If the exponential distribution is used, the CDF is\n\\[F(D_i | \\lambda_i) = 1 - \\text{exp}(-\\lambda_i D_i)\\]\nwhere the complement is (here we use \\(S\\) to denote the equivalence of the survival function and CCDF)\n\\[S(D_i|\\lambda) = \\text{exp}(-\\lambda_i D_i)\\]\nWhich is what we need in our model since it is the probability of waiting \\(D_i\\) days without being adopted yet. The pm.Censored from PyMC offers a convenient way to model censored data and the probability density function (PDF) is defined as\n\\[\\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{for } x &lt; \\text{lower}, \\\\\n\\text{CDF}(\\text{lower}, \\text{dist}) & \\text{for } x = \\text{lower}, \\\\\n\\text{PDF}(x, \\text{dist}) & \\text{for } \\text{lower} &lt; x &lt; \\text{upper}, \\\\\n1 - \\text{CDF}(\\text{upper}, \\text{dist}) & \\text{for } x = \\text{upper}, \\\\\n0 & \\text{for } x &gt; \\text{upper}.\n\\end{cases}\\]\nwhere lower is left-censored and upper is right-censored. Our cat adoption dataset is right-censored. Therefore, lower can be None, and upper is the observed times when an event occurs. The pm.Censored uses the CCDF to answer the question we are interested in: what is the probability of not being adopted yet, given the observation time so far?\n\n\nTo understand how this is used, lets use Bambi to recover the parameters of the censored distribution with no predictors. Before the model is fit, days_to_event is scaled to represent months as the raw values contain very large values. This scaling ensures a smoother sampling process.\nAdditionally, modeling censored data in Bambi requires a new formula syntax censored(time, event) on the response term. censored indicates we want to model censored data and gets parsed where time and event are passed into a Bambi transformation function censored. This function takes two arguments: the first being the observed value \\(Y\\) (in this example time), and the second being the type of censoring of the event. In Bambi, it is possible to have left, none, right, and interval censoring. event needs to be encoded as one of the censoring types. In our cat adoption example, we will encode the adoption event as right.\nLastly, the exponential distribution is used to model the cat adoption rate parameter. But why not enter censored as the likelihood like we normally do in Bambi? The pm.Censored is indeed eventually used as the likelihood. However, there also needs to be a distribution that models the rate parameter. In this example it is the exponential distribution.

Analyzing the CDF (right plot), the majority of cats, about \\(0.97\\), are adopted by the sixth month. Now that we have an intuition on how pm.Censored is used for modeling censored data, in the next section, we will discuss how to model censored data with predictors."

    "text": "It is often the case that we would like to understand how various predictors are associated with the survival function. For example, we may want to know if the survival function for cats of different colors or species is different. As outlined above, we cannot simply run a regression on the observed times \\(Y\\) given some predictors \\(X\\). What we are actually interested in is predicting the survival time \\(T\\) given the predictors \\(X\\). To achieve this, we first need to understand the Hazard function and the Cox proportional hazards model.\n\n\nIn survival analysis, it is often more convenient to express the survival function in terms of the hazards rate, which is closely related to the survival function \\(S(t)\\), and is the instantaneous rate of an event occuring at time \\(t\\) given that the event has not yet occured.\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{align*}\n\\lambda(t)\n    & = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{P(t &lt; T &lt; t + \\Delta t\\ |\\ T &gt; t) / \\Delta t}{Pr(T &gt; t)} \\\\\n    & = \\lim_{{\\Delta t \\to 0}} \\frac{Pr(t &lt; T \\leq t + \\Delta t) / \\Delta t}{Pr(T &gt; t)} \\\\\n    & = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\n\\end{align*}\\end{split}\\]\nwhere\n\\[f(t) = \\lim_{{\\Delta t \\to 0}} \\frac{Pr(t &lt; T \\leq t + \\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the (unobserved) survival time and \\(f(t)\\) is the PDF associated with \\(T\\). The relationship between the hazard function and the survival function can be described in terms of the likelihood \\(L\\)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nL_i =\n\\begin{cases}\nf(y_i) & \\text{if the } i\\text{th observation is not censored} \\\\\nS(y_i) & \\text{if the } i\\text{th observation is censored}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIf \\(Y = y_i\\) and the \\(i\\text{th}\\) observation is not censored, then the likelihood is the probability of the event in a tiny interval around time \\(y_i\\). If the \\(i\\text{th}\\) observation is censored, then the likelihood is the probability of surviving at least until time \\(y_i\\). We have now seen two ways to model the survival times: (1) a non-parametric estimator such as Kaplan-Meier, and (2) a parametric model using the PDF \\(f(t)\\) to estimate the hazard rate. However, what we would really like to do is to model the survival time as a function of the predictors. Thus, instead of working with the PDF \\(f(t)\\), we work directly with the hazard function to model the survival time as a function of predictors.\n\n\n\nAbove, we developed a model with no predictors to recover the parameters of the cat adoption rate, and used this as input into the pm.Censored distribution. Since we would now like to add predictor(s), we need to reformulate our modeling task into a risk regression model as it allows us to model the hazard rate as a function of our predictors. Specifically, the Cox proportional hazards model. With predictors \\(x_j\\) and regression coefficients \\(\\beta\\), the hazard rate is modeled as\n\\[\\lambda(t|x_i) = \\lambda_0(t)\\text{exp}(\\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}\\beta_j)\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda_{0}t\\) is the baseline hazard rate independent of the predictors. This baseline hazard rate is unspecified (or unidentified) and means that we allow the instantaneous probability of an event at time \\(t\\), given that a subject has survived at least until time \\(t\\), to take any form. Practically speaking, this means that the hazard function is very flexible and can model a wide range of relationships between the covariates and survival time. One can interpret the Cox proportional hazards model as a one-unit increase in \\(x_{ij}\\) corresponds to an increase in \\(\\lambda(t, x_i)\\) by a factor of \\(\\text{exp}(\\beta_j)\\). In the next section, it is discussed how to develop a regression model with survival responses and predictors."

In the backend, the rate is modeled as a function of the specified predictors in the Bambi model.

    "text": "Main Idea\nMetropolis-Hastings (MH) is one of the simplest kinds of MCMC algorithms. The idea with MH is that at each step, we propose to move from the current state \\(x\\) to a new state \\(x'\\) with probability \\(q(x'|x)\\), where \\(q\\) is the proposal distribution. The user is free to choose the proposal distribution and the choice of the proposal is dependent on the form of the target distribution. Once a proposal has been made to move to \\(x'\\), we then decide whether to accept or reject the proposal according to some rule. If the proposal is accepted, the new state is \\(x'\\), else the new state is the same as the current state \\(x\\).\nProposals can be symmetric and asymmetric. In the case of symmetric proposals \\(q(x'|x) = q(x|x')\\), the acceptance probability is given by the rule:\n\\[A = min(1, \\frac{p^*(x')}{p^*(x)})\\]\nThe fraction is a ratio between the probabilities of the proposed state \\(x'\\) and current state \\(x\\). If \\(x'\\) is more probable than \\(x\\), the ratio is \\(&gt; 1\\), and we move to the proposed state. However, if \\(x'\\) is less probable, we may still move there, depending on the relative probabilities. If the relative probabilities are similar, we may code exploration into the algorithm such that they go in the opposite direction. This helps with the greediness of the original algorithm—only moving to more probable states.\n\n\nThe Algorithm\n\nInitialize \\(x^0\\)\nfor \\(s = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\\) do:\n\nDefine \\(x = x^s\\)\nSample \\(x' \\sim q(x'|x)\\) where \\(q\\) is the user’s proposal distribution\nCompute the acceptance probability given by:\n\\(p_a(x_{t+1}|x_i) = min(1, \\frac{p(x_{i+1})q(x_i | x_{i+1})}{p(x_i)q(x_{i+1}|x_I)})\\)\n\nCompute \\(A = min(1, \\alpha)\\)\nSample \\(u \\sim U(0, 1)\\)\nSet new sample to: \\(x^{s+1} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}  x' & \\quad \\text{if} \\quad u \\leq A(\\text{accept}) \\\\  x & \\quad \\text{if} \\quad x &gt; A(\\text{reject}) \\\\ \\end{array} \\right.\\)\n\n\n\nRandom Walk Metropolis-Hastings\nThe random walk metropolis-hastings (RWMH) corresponds to MH with a Gaussian propsal distribution of the form:\n\\[q(x'|x) = \\mathcal{N}(x'|x, \\tau^2 I)\\]\nBelow, I implement the RWMH for sampling from a 1-dimenensional mixture of Gaussians (implemented using the MixtureSameFamily PyTorch class) with the following parameters:\n\n\\(\\mu = -20, 20\\)\nMixture component probability \\(= 0.3, 0.7\\)\n\\(\\sum = 10, 10\\)\n\n\n\nCode\ndef plot(distribution, trace_history, xmin, xmax, n_iterations, n_evals=500):\n\n    x_evals = torch.linspace(xmin, xmax, n_evals)\n    evals = torch.exp(distribution.log_prob(x_evals))\n    \n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))\n\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1)\n    ax.plot(torch.arange(n_iterations), trace_history)\n    ax.set_xlabel('Iterations')\n    ax.set_ylabel('Sampled Value')\n\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2, projection='3d')\n    ax.plot(torch.arange(n_iterations), trace_history)\n    ax.plot(torch.zeros(n_evals), x_evals, evals)\n    ax.set_xlabel('Iterations')\n    ax.set_ylabel('Sampled Value')\n\n    fig.suptitle('Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings')\n    plt.show()\n\n\ndef true_distribution(mixture_probs, mus, scales):\n\n    return dist.MixtureSameFamily(\n        mixture_distribution=dist.Categorical(probs=mixture_probs),\n        component_distribution=dist.Normal(loc=mus, scale=scales)\n        )\n\n\n\ndef metropolis_hasting(x0, tau, mixture, n_iterations, rng_key=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    implements the random walk metropolis-hasting algorithm\n    \"\"\"\n\n    x_current = x0\n    x_samples = torch.zeros(n_iterations)\n    x_samples[0] = x_current\n    cnt_acceptance = 0\n     \n    for n in range(1, n_iterations):\n        \n        # datum of proposed state x'\n        x_candidate = x_current + tau * dist.Normal(loc=0, scale=1).sample()\n        # probs. of proposed state x'\n        p_candidate = torch.exp(mixture.log_prob(x_candidate))\n        # probs. of current state x\n        p_current = torch.exp(mixture.log_prob(x_current))\n        \n        # acceptance formula\n        alpha = p_candidate / p_current\n        probs_accept = min(1, alpha)\n        \n        # sample u ~ U(0, 1)\n        u = dist.Uniform(0, 1).sample()\n\n        if u &gt;= probs_accept:\n            x_current = x_current\n        else:\n            x_current = x_candidate\n            cnt_acceptance += 1\n\n        x_samples[n] = x_current\n\n    acceptence_ratio = cnt_acceptance / n_iterations\n    print('---- statistics ----')\n    print(f'acceptance rate = {acceptence_ratio}')\n\n    return x_samples\n\n\ndef main(args):\n\n    # initial parameter value\n    x0 = torch.tensor(20.)\n\n    # mixture dist. parameters\n    mixture_probs = torch.tensor([0.3, 0.7])\n    mus = torch.tensor([-20., 20.])\n    scales = torch.tensor([10., 10.])\n\n    n_iters = args.iters\n    tau = torch.tensor(args.tau)\n\n    mixture_distribution = true_distribution(mixture_probs, mus, scales)\n    x_samples = metropolis_hasting(x0, tau, mixture_distribution, n_iters)\n\n    plot(mixture_distribution, x_samples, -100, 100, n_iters)\n\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='rw-mh')\nparser.add_argument('--iters', type=int, default=1000)\nparser.add_argument('--tau', type=float, default=8.)\nargs = parser.parse_args(\"\")\n\nmain(args)\n\n---- statistics ----\nacceptance rate = 0.803\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nThe mixture distribution can be tricky to sample from as it is has more than one model, i.e., it is a bimodal distribution.

Due to the random search based perturbations (random walk), the sampler seems to randomly jump from component to component, showing that the chain is not sticky. Additionally, the acceptance rate is \\(0.803\\) indicating that about \\(80\\%\\) of new proposals were accepted."

    "title": "Predict New Groups with Hierarchical Models in Bambi",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In Bambi, it is possible to perform predictions on new, unseen, groups of data that were not in the observed data used to fit the model with the argument sample_new_groups in the model.predict() method. This is useful in the context of hierarchical modeling, where groups are assumed to be a sample from a larger group.\nThis blog post is a copy of the zero inflated models documentation I wrote for Bambi. The original post can be found here.\nBelow, it is first described how predictions at multiple levels and for unseen groups are possible with hierarchical models. Then, it is described how this is performed in Bambi. Lastly, a hierarchical model is developed to show how to use the sample_new_groups argument in the model.predict() method, and within the interpret sub-package. For users coming from brms in R, this is equivalent to the sample_new_levels argument.\n\n\nA feature of hierarchical models is that they are able to make predictions at multiple levels. For example, if we were to use the penguin dataset to fit a hierchical regression to estimate the body mass of each penguin species given a set of predictors, we could estimate the mass of all penguins and each individual species at the same time. Thus, in this example, there are predictions for two levels: (1) the population level, and (2) the species level.\nAdditionally, a hierarchical model can be used to make predictions for groups (levels) that were never seen before if a hyperprior is defined over the group-specific effect. With a hyperior defined on group-specific effects, the groups do not share one fixed parameter, but rather share a hyperprior distribution which describes the distribution for the parameter of the prior itself. Lets write a hierarchical model (without intercepts) with a hyperprior defined for group-specific effects in statistical notation so this concept becomes more clear:\n\\[\\beta_{\\mu h} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 10)\\] \\[\\beta_{\\sigma h} \\sim \\mathcal{HN}(10)\\] \\[\\beta_{m} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta_{\\mu h}, \\beta_{\\sigma h})\\] \\[\\sigma_{h} \\sim \\mathcal{HN}(10)\\] \\[\\sigma_{m} \\sim \\mathcal{HN}(\\sigma_{h})\\] \\[Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta_{m} * X_{m}, \\sigma_{m})\\]\nThe parameters \\(\\beta_{\\mu h}, \\beta_{\\sigma h}\\) of the group-specific effect prior \\(\\beta_{m}\\) come from hyperprior distributions. Thus, if we would like to make predictions for a new, unseen, group, we can do so by first sampling from these hyperprior distributions to obtain the parameters for the new group, and then sample from the posterior or posterior predictive distribution to obtain the estimates for the new group. For a more in depth explanation of hierarchical models in Bambi, see either: the radon example, or the sleep study example.\n\n\n\nIf data with unseen groups are passed to the new_data argument of the model.predict() method, Bambi first needs to identify if that group exists, and if not, to evaluate the new group with the respective group-specific term. This evaluation updates the design matrix initially used to fit the model with the new group(s). This is achieved with the .evaluate_new_data method in the formulae package.\nOnce the design matrix has been updated, Bambi can perform predictions on the new, unseen, groups by specifying sample_new_groups=True in model.predict(). Each posterior sample for the new groups is drawn from the posterior draws of a randomly selected existing group. Since different groups may be selected at each draw, the end result represents the variation across existing groups.\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate the sample_new_groups argument, we will develop a hierarchical model on the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression dataset. Pulmonary fibrosis is a disorder with no known cause and no known cure, created by scarring of the lungs. Using a hierarchical model, the objective is to predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled by the patient.\n\n\nCode\nimport arviz as az\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport warnings\n\nimport bambi as bmb\n\nwarnings.simplefilter(action=\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)\n\n\n\n\nIn the dataset, we were provided with a baseline chest computerized tomography (CT) scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients where the columns represent the following\n\npatient- a unique id for each patient\nweeks- the relative number of weeks pre/post the baseline CT (may be negative)\nfvc - the recorded lung capacity in millilitres (ml)\npercent- a computed field which approximates the patient’s FVC as a percent of the typical FVC for a person of similar characteristics\nsex - male or female\nsmoking_status - ex-smoker, never smoked, currently smokes\nage - age of the patient\n\nA patient has an image acquired at time week = 0 and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their FVC is measured.

This is a good scenario to use a hierarchical model, where we can model the FVC measurements for each patient as a function of time, and also model the variability in the FVC measurements across patients.\n\n\n\nThe hierarchical model we will develop is a partially pooled model using the predictors weeks, smoking_status, and patient to predict the response fvc. We will estimate the following model with common and group-effects:\n\ncommon-effects: weeks and smoking_status\ngroup-effects: the slope of weeks will vary by patient\n\nAdditionally, the global intercept is not included. Since the global intercept is excluded, smoking_status uses cell means encoding (i.e. the coefficient represents the estimate for each smoking_status category of the entire group). This logic also applies for weeks. However, a group-effect is also specified for weeks, which means that the association between weeks and the fvc is allowed to vary by individual patients.\nBelow, the default prior for the group-effect sigma is changed from HalfNormal to a Gamma distribution. Additionally, the model graph shows the model has been reparameterized to be non-centered. This is the default when there are group-effects in Bambi.\n\npriors = {\n    \"weeks|patient\": bmb.Prior(\"Normal\", mu=0, sigma=bmb.Prior(\"Gamma\", alpha=3, beta=3)),\n}\n\nmodel = bmb.Model(\n    \"fvc ~ 0 + weeks + smoking_status + (0 + weeks | patient)\",\n    data, \n    priors=priors,\n    categorical=[\"patient\", \"smoking_status\"],\n)\nmodel.build()\nmodel.graph()\n\n\n\n\n\nidata = model.fit(\n    draws=1500,\n    tune=1000,\n    target_accept=0.95,\n    chains=4,\n    random_seed=42,\n    cores=10,\n)\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 10 jobs)\nNUTS: [fvc_sigma, weeks, smoking_status, weeks|patient_sigma, weeks|patient_offset]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_500 draw iterations (4_000 + 6_000 draws total) took 10 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [10000/10000 00:10&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical models can induce difficult posterior geometries to sample from.

However, weeks|patients indicates some patients are negative, some are positive, and some are close to zero. Moreover, there are varying levels of uncertainty observed in the coefficients for the three different values of the smoking_status variable.\n\naz.summary(idata, var_names=[\"weeks\", \"smoking_status\", \"fvc_sigma\", \"weeks|patient_sigma\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nweeks\n-0.116\n0.036\n-0.183\n-0.048\n0.002\n0.001\n447.0\n836.0\n1.01\n\n\nsmoking_status[Currently smokes]\n0.398\n0.017\n0.364\n0.429\n0.000\n0.000\n3315.0\n4274.0\n1.00\n\n\nsmoking_status[Ex-smoker]\n0.382\n0.005\n0.373\n0.392\n0.000\n0.000\n5104.0\n4835.0\n1.00\n\n\nsmoking_status[Never smoked]\n0.291\n0.007\n0.277\n0.305\n0.000\n0.000\n3299.0\n4290.0\n1.00\n\n\nfvc_sigma\n0.077\n0.001\n0.074\n0.080\n0.000\n0.000\n8405.0\n4362.0\n1.00\n\n\nweeks|patient_sigma\n0.458\n0.027\n0.412\n0.511\n0.001\n0.001\n767.0\n1559.0\n1.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effective sample size (ESS) is much lower for the weeks and weeks|patient_sigma parameters. This can also be inferred visually by looking at the trace plots for these parameters above. There seems to be some autocorrelation in the samples for these parameters. However, for the sake of this example, we will not worry about this.\n\n\n\nFirst, we will use the posterior distribution to plot the mean and 95% credible interval for the FVC measurements of the three randomly sampled patients above.\n\npreds = model.predict(idata, kind=\"mean\", inplace=False)\nfvc_mean = az.extract(preds[\"posterior\"])[\"fvc_mean\"]\n\n\n# plot posterior predictions\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(12, 3), sharey=True)\nfor i, p in enumerate(patient_id):\n    idx = data.index[data[\"patient\"] == p].tolist()\n    weeks = data.loc[idx, \"weeks\"].values\n    fvc = data.loc[idx, \"fvc\"].values\n\n    ax[i].scatter(weeks, fvc)\n    az.plot_hdi(weeks, fvc_mean[idx].T, color=\"C0\", ax=ax[i])\n    ax[i].plot(weeks, fvc_mean[idx].mean(axis=1), color=\"C0\")\n\n    ax[i].set_xlabel(\"weeks\")\n    ax[i].set_ylabel(\"fvc\")\n    ax[i].set_title(f\"patient {p}\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\nThe plots show that the posterior estimates seem to fit the three patients well. Where there are more observations, the credible interval is smaller, and where there are fewer observations, the credible interval is larger. Next, we will predict new, unseen, patients.\n\n\n\nImagine the cost of acquiring a CT scan increases dramatically, and we would like to interopolate the FVC measurement for a new patient with a given set of clinical information smoking_status and weeks. We achieve this by passing this data to the predict method and setting sample_new_groups=True. As outlined in the Sampling new groups in Bambi section, this new data is evaluated by formulae to update the design matrix, and then predictions are made for the new group by sampling from the posterior draws of a randomly selected existing group.\nBelow, we will simulate a new patient and predict their FVC measurements over time. First, we will copy clinical data from patient 39 and use it for patient 176 (the new, unseen, patient). Subsequently, we will construct another new patient, with different clinical data.\n\n# copy patient 39 data to the new patient 176\npatient_39 = data[data[\"patient\"] == 39].reset_index(drop=True)\nnew_data = patient_39.copy()\nnew_data[\"patient\"] = 176\nnew_data = pd.concat([new_data, patient_39]).reset_index(drop=True)[predictors]\nnew_data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatient\nweeks\nfvc\nsmoking_status\n\n\n\n\n0\n176\n0.355072\n0.378141\nEx-smoker\n\n\n1\n176\n0.376812\n0.365937\nEx-smoker\n\n\n2\n176\n0.391304\n0.401651\nEx-smoker\n\n\n3\n176\n0.405797\n0.405958\nEx-smoker\n\n\n4\n176\n0.420290\n0.390883\nEx-smoker\n\n\n5\n176\n0.456522\n0.390165\nEx-smoker\n\n\n6\n176\n0.543478\n0.348528\nEx-smoker\n\n\n7\n176\n0.637681\n0.337581\nEx-smoker\n\n\n8\n176\n0.746377\n0.365219\nEx-smoker\n\n\n9\n176\n0.775362\n0.360014\nEx-smoker\n\n\n10\n39\n0.355072\n0.378141\nEx-smoker\n\n\n11\n39\n0.376812\n0.365937\nEx-smoker\n\n\n12\n39\n0.391304\n0.401651\nEx-smoker\n\n\n13\n39\n0.405797\n0.405958\nEx-smoker\n\n\n14\n39\n0.420290\n0.390883\nEx-smoker\n\n\n15\n39\n0.456522\n0.390165\nEx-smoker\n\n\n16\n39\n0.543478\n0.348528\nEx-smoker\n\n\n17\n39\n0.637681\n0.337581\nEx-smoker\n\n\n18\n39\n0.746377\n0.365219\nEx-smoker\n\n\n19\n39\n0.775362\n0.360014\nEx-smoker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npreds = model.predict(\n    idata, kind=\"mean\",\n    data=new_data, \n    sample_new_groups=True,\n    inplace=False\n)\n\n\n# utility func for plotting\ndef plot_new_patient(idata, data, patient_ids):\n    fvc_mean = az.extract(idata[\"posterior\"])[\"fvc_mean\"]\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 3), sharey=True)\n    for i, p in enumerate(patient_ids):\n        idx = data.index[data[\"patient\"] == p].tolist()\n        weeks = data.loc[idx, \"weeks\"].values\n        fvc = data.loc[idx, \"fvc\"].values\n\n        if p == patient_ids[0]:\n            ax[i].scatter(weeks, fvc)\n\n        az.plot_hdi(weeks, fvc_mean[idx].T, color=\"C0\", ax=ax[i])\n        ax[i].plot(weeks, fvc_mean[idx].mean(axis=1), color=\"C0\")\n\n        ax[i].set_xlabel(\"weeks\")\n        ax[i].set_ylabel(\"fvc\")\n        ax[i].set_title(f\"patient {p}\")\n\n\nplot_new_patient(preds, new_data, [39, 176])\n\n\n\n\nAlthough identical data was used for both patients, the variability increased consideribly for patient 176.

Thus, we set sample_new_groups=True and obtain predictions for the new patient.\n\npreds = model.predict(\n    idata, kind=\"mean\",\n    data=new_data, \n    sample_new_groups=True,\n    inplace=False\n)\n\n\nplot_new_patient(preds, new_data, [39, 176])\n\n\n\n\nWith smoking_status = \"Currently smokes\", and the time of follow up visit randomly selected, we can see that the intercept is slightly higher, and it appears that the slope is steeper for this new patient. Again, the variability is much higher for patient 176, and in particular, where there are fewer fvc measurements.\n\n\nThe interpret sub-package in Bambi allows us to easily interpret the predictions for new patients. In particular, using bmb.interpret.comparisons, we can compare the predictions made for a new patient and an existing similar patient. Below, we will compare the predictions made for patient 176 and patient 39. We will use the same clinical data for both patients as we did in the first exampe above.\n\ntime_of_follow_up = list(new_data.query(\"patient == 39\")[\"weeks\"].values)\ntime_of_follow_up\n\n[0.35507246376811596,\n 0.37681159420289856,\n 0.391304347826087,\n 0.4057971014492754,\n 0.42028985507246375,\n 0.45652173913043476,\n 0.5434782608695652,\n 0.6376811594202898,\n 0.7463768115942029,\n 0.7753623188405797]\n\n\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_comparisons(\n    model,\n    idata,\n    contrast={\"patient\": [39, 176]},\n    conditional={\"weeks\": time_of_follow_up, \"smoking_status\": \"Ex-smoker\"},\n    sample_new_groups=True,\n    fig_kwargs={\"figsize\": (7, 3)}\n)\nplt.title(\"Difference in predictions for patient 176 vs 39\");\n\n\n\n\nReferring to the plots where patient 39 and 176 use identical data, the mean fvc predictions “look” about the same. When this comparison is made quantitatively using the comparisons function, we can see that mean fvc measurements are slightly below 0.0, and have a constant slope across weeks indicating there is a slight difference in mean fvc measurements between the two patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this notebook, it was shown how predictions at multiple levels and for unseen groups are possible with hierarchical models. To utilize this feature of hierarchical models, Bambi first updates the design matrix to include the new group. Then, predictions are made for the new group by sampling from the posterior draws of a randomly selected existing group.\nTo predict new groups in Bambi, you can either: (1) create a dataset with new groups and pass it to the model.predict() method while specifying sample_new_groups=True, or (2) use the functions comparisons or slopes in the interpret sub-package with sample_new_groups=True to compare predictions or slopes for new groups and existing groups.\n\n%load_ext watermark\n%watermark -n -u -v -iv -w\n\nLast updated: Tue Oct 10 2023\n\nPython implementation: CPython\nPython version       : 3.11.0\nIPython version      : 8.13.2\n\nmatplotlib: 3.7.1\narviz     : 0.16.1\npandas    : 2.1.0\nnumpy     : 1.24.2\nbambi     : 0.13.0.dev0\n\nWatermark: 2.3.1"

    "text": "A feature of hierarchical models is that they are able to make predictions at multiple levels. For example, if we were to use the penguin dataset to fit a hierchical regression to estimate the body mass of each penguin species given a set of predictors, we could estimate the mass of all penguins and each individual species at the same time. Thus, in this example, there are predictions for two levels: (1) the population level, and (2) the species level.\nAdditionally, a hierarchical model can be used to make predictions for groups (levels) that were never seen before if a hyperprior is defined over the group-specific effect. With a hyperior defined on group-specific effects, the groups do not share one fixed parameter, but rather share a hyperprior distribution which describes the distribution for the parameter of the prior itself. Lets write a hierarchical model (without intercepts) with a hyperprior defined for group-specific effects in statistical notation so this concept becomes more clear:\n\\[\\beta_{\\mu h} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 10)\\] \\[\\beta_{\\sigma h} \\sim \\mathcal{HN}(10)\\] \\[\\beta_{m} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta_{\\mu h}, \\beta_{\\sigma h})\\] \\[\\sigma_{h} \\sim \\mathcal{HN}(10)\\] \\[\\sigma_{m} \\sim \\mathcal{HN}(\\sigma_{h})\\] \\[Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta_{m} * X_{m}, \\sigma_{m})\\]\nThe parameters \\(\\beta_{\\mu h}, \\beta_{\\sigma h}\\) of the group-specific effect prior \\(\\beta_{m}\\) come from hyperprior distributions. Thus, if we would like to make predictions for a new, unseen, group, we can do so by first sampling from these hyperprior distributions to obtain the parameters for the new group, and then sample from the posterior or posterior predictive distribution to obtain the estimates for the new group. For a more in depth explanation of hierarchical models in Bambi, see either: the radon example, or the sleep study example."

    "text": "If data with unseen groups are passed to the new_data argument of the model.predict() method, Bambi first needs to identify if that group exists, and if not, to evaluate the new group with the respective group-specific term. This evaluation updates the design matrix initially used to fit the model with the new group(s). This is achieved with the .evaluate_new_data method in the formulae package.\nOnce the design matrix has been updated, Bambi can perform predictions on the new, unseen, groups by specifying sample_new_groups=True in model.predict(). Each posterior sample for the new groups is drawn from the posterior draws of a randomly selected existing group. Since different groups may be selected at each draw, the end result represents the variation across existing groups."

Pulmonary fibrosis is a disorder with no known cause and no known cure, created by scarring of the lungs. Using a hierarchical model, the objective is to predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function.

This is a good scenario to use a hierarchical model, where we can model the FVC measurements for each patient as a function of time, and also model the variability in the FVC measurements across patients.\n\n\n\nThe hierarchical model we will develop is a partially pooled model using the predictors weeks, smoking_status, and patient to predict the response fvc. We will estimate the following model with common and group-effects:\n\ncommon-effects: weeks and smoking_status\ngroup-effects: the slope of weeks will vary by patient\n\nAdditionally, the global intercept is not included. Since the global intercept is excluded, smoking_status uses cell means encoding (i.e. the coefficient represents the estimate for each smoking_status category of the entire group). This logic also applies for weeks. However, a group-effect is also specified for weeks, which means that the association between weeks and the fvc is allowed to vary by individual patients.\nBelow, the default prior for the group-effect sigma is changed from HalfNormal to a Gamma distribution. Additionally, the model graph shows the model has been reparameterized to be non-centered. This is the default when there are group-effects in Bambi.\n\npriors = {\n    \"weeks|patient\": bmb.Prior(\"Normal\", mu=0, sigma=bmb.Prior(\"Gamma\", alpha=3, beta=3)),\n}\n\nmodel = bmb.Model(\n    \"fvc ~ 0 + weeks + smoking_status + (0 + weeks | patient)\",\n    data, \n    priors=priors,\n    categorical=[\"patient\", \"smoking_status\"],\n)\nmodel.build()\nmodel.graph()\n\n\n\n\n\nidata = model.fit(\n    draws=1500,\n    tune=1000,\n    target_accept=0.95,\n    chains=4,\n    random_seed=42,\n    cores=10,\n)\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 10 jobs)\nNUTS: [fvc_sigma, weeks, smoking_status, weeks|patient_sigma, weeks|patient_offset]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_500 draw iterations (4_000 + 6_000 draws total) took 10 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [10000/10000 00:10&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical models can induce difficult posterior geometries to sample from.

Moreover, there are varying levels of uncertainty observed in the coefficients for the three different values of the smoking_status variable.\n\naz.summary(idata, var_names=[\"weeks\", \"smoking_status\", \"fvc_sigma\", \"weeks|patient_sigma\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nweeks\n-0.116\n0.036\n-0.183\n-0.048\n0.002\n0.001\n447.0\n836.0\n1.01\n\n\nsmoking_status[Currently smokes]\n0.398\n0.017\n0.364\n0.429\n0.000\n0.000\n3315.0\n4274.0\n1.00\n\n\nsmoking_status[Ex-smoker]\n0.382\n0.005\n0.373\n0.392\n0.000\n0.000\n5104.0\n4835.0\n1.00\n\n\nsmoking_status[Never smoked]\n0.291\n0.007\n0.277\n0.305\n0.000\n0.000\n3299.0\n4290.0\n1.00\n\n\nfvc_sigma\n0.077\n0.001\n0.074\n0.080\n0.000\n0.000\n8405.0\n4362.0\n1.00\n\n\nweeks|patient_sigma\n0.458\n0.027\n0.412\n0.511\n0.001\n0.001\n767.0\n1559.0\n1.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effective sample size (ESS) is much lower for the weeks and weeks|patient_sigma parameters. This can also be inferred visually by looking at the trace plots for these parameters above. There seems to be some autocorrelation in the samples for these parameters. However, for the sake of this example, we will not worry about this.\n\n\n\nFirst, we will use the posterior distribution to plot the mean and 95% credible interval for the FVC measurements of the three randomly sampled patients above.\n\npreds = model.predict(idata, kind=\"mean\", inplace=False)\nfvc_mean = az.extract(preds[\"posterior\"])[\"fvc_mean\"]\n\n\n# plot posterior predictions\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(12, 3), sharey=True)\nfor i, p in enumerate(patient_id):\n    idx = data.index[data[\"patient\"] == p].tolist()\n    weeks = data.loc[idx, \"weeks\"].values\n    fvc = data.loc[idx, \"fvc\"].values\n\n    ax[i].scatter(weeks, fvc)\n    az.plot_hdi(weeks, fvc_mean[idx].T, color=\"C0\", ax=ax[i])\n    ax[i].plot(weeks, fvc_mean[idx].mean(axis=1), color=\"C0\")\n\n    ax[i].set_xlabel(\"weeks\")\n    ax[i].set_ylabel(\"fvc\")\n    ax[i].set_title(f\"patient {p}\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\nThe plots show that the posterior estimates seem to fit the three patients well. Where there are more observations, the credible interval is smaller, and where there are fewer observations, the credible interval is larger. Next, we will predict new, unseen, patients.\n\n\n\nImagine the cost of acquiring a CT scan increases dramatically, and we would like to interopolate the FVC measurement for a new patient with a given set of clinical information smoking_status and weeks. We achieve this by passing this data to the predict method and setting sample_new_groups=True. As outlined in the Sampling new groups in Bambi section, this new data is evaluated by formulae to update the design matrix, and then predictions are made for the new group by sampling from the posterior draws of a randomly selected existing group.\nBelow, we will simulate a new patient and predict their FVC measurements over time. First, we will copy clinical data from patient 39 and use it for patient 176 (the new, unseen, patient). Subsequently, we will construct another new patient, with different clinical data.\n\n# copy patient 39 data to the new patient 176\npatient_39 = data[data[\"patient\"] == 39].reset_index(drop=True)\nnew_data = patient_39.copy()\nnew_data[\"patient\"] = 176\nnew_data = pd.concat([new_data, patient_39]).reset_index(drop=True)[predictors]\nnew_data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatient\nweeks\nfvc\nsmoking_status\n\n\n\n\n0\n176\n0.355072\n0.378141\nEx-smoker\n\n\n1\n176\n0.376812\n0.365937\nEx-smoker\n\n\n2\n176\n0.391304\n0.401651\nEx-smoker\n\n\n3\n176\n0.405797\n0.405958\nEx-smoker\n\n\n4\n176\n0.420290\n0.390883\nEx-smoker\n\n\n5\n176\n0.456522\n0.390165\nEx-smoker\n\n\n6\n176\n0.543478\n0.348528\nEx-smoker\n\n\n7\n176\n0.637681\n0.337581\nEx-smoker\n\n\n8\n176\n0.746377\n0.365219\nEx-smoker\n\n\n9\n176\n0.775362\n0.360014\nEx-smoker\n\n\n10\n39\n0.355072\n0.378141\nEx-smoker\n\n\n11\n39\n0.376812\n0.365937\nEx-smoker\n\n\n12\n39\n0.391304\n0.401651\nEx-smoker\n\n\n13\n39\n0.405797\n0.405958\nEx-smoker\n\n\n14\n39\n0.420290\n0.390883\nEx-smoker\n\n\n15\n39\n0.456522\n0.390165\nEx-smoker\n\n\n16\n39\n0.543478\n0.348528\nEx-smoker\n\n\n17\n39\n0.637681\n0.337581\nEx-smoker\n\n\n18\n39\n0.746377\n0.365219\nEx-smoker\n\n\n19\n39\n0.775362\n0.360014\nEx-smoker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npreds = model.predict(\n    idata, kind=\"mean\",\n    data=new_data, \n    sample_new_groups=True,\n    inplace=False\n)\n\n\n# utility func for plotting\ndef plot_new_patient(idata, data, patient_ids):\n    fvc_mean = az.extract(idata[\"posterior\"])[\"fvc_mean\"]\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 3), sharey=True)\n    for i, p in enumerate(patient_ids):\n        idx = data.index[data[\"patient\"] == p].tolist()\n        weeks = data.loc[idx, \"weeks\"].values\n        fvc = data.loc[idx, \"fvc\"].values\n\n        if p == patient_ids[0]:\n            ax[i].scatter(weeks, fvc)\n\n        az.plot_hdi(weeks, fvc_mean[idx].T, color=\"C0\", ax=ax[i])\n        ax[i].plot(weeks, fvc_mean[idx].mean(axis=1), color=\"C0\")\n\n        ax[i].set_xlabel(\"weeks\")\n        ax[i].set_ylabel(\"fvc\")\n        ax[i].set_title(f\"patient {p}\")\n\n\nplot_new_patient(preds, new_data, [39, 176])\n\n\n\n\nAlthough identical data was used for both patients, the variability increased consideribly for patient 176.

Thus, we set sample_new_groups=True and obtain predictions for the new patient.\n\npreds = model.predict(\n    idata, kind=\"mean\",\n    data=new_data, \n    sample_new_groups=True,\n    inplace=False\n)\n\n\nplot_new_patient(preds, new_data, [39, 176])\n\n\n\n\nWith smoking_status = \"Currently smokes\", and the time of follow up visit randomly selected, we can see that the intercept is slightly higher, and it appears that the slope is steeper for this new patient. Again, the variability is much higher for patient 176, and in particular, where there are fewer fvc measurements.\n\n\nThe interpret sub-package in Bambi allows us to easily interpret the predictions for new patients.

    "text": "Interpretation of Regression Coefficients\nAssuming we have fit a linear regression model of the form\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_k x_k + \\epsilon\\]\nthe “safest” interpretation of the regression coefficients \\(\\beta\\) is as a comparison between two groups of items that differ by \\(1\\) in the relevant predictor variable \\(x_i\\) while being identical in all the other predictors. Formally, the predicted difference between two items \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) that differ by an amount \\(n\\) on predictor \\(k\\), but are identical on all other predictors, the predicted difference is \\(y_i - y_j\\) is \\(\\beta_kx\\), on average.\nHowever, once we move away from a regression model with a Gaussian response, the identity function, and no interaction terms, the interpretation of the coefficients are not as straightforward. For example, in a logistic regression model, the coefficients are on a different scale and are measured in logits (log odds), not probabilities or percentage points. Thus, you cannot interpret the coefficents as a “one unit increase in \\(x_k\\) is associated with an \\(n\\) percentage point decrease in \\(y\\)”. First, the logits must be converted to the probability scale. Secondly, a one unit change in \\(x_k\\) may produce a larger or smaller change in the outcome, depending upon how far away from zero the logits are.\nslopes and plot_slopes, by default, computes quantities of interest on the response scale for GLMs. For example, for a logistic regression model, this is the probability scale, and for a Poisson regression model, this is the count scale.\n\nInterpreting interaction effects\nSpecifying interactions in a regression model is a way of allowing parameters to be conditional on certain aspects of the data. By contrast, for a model with no interactions, the parameters are not conditional and thus, the value of one parameter is not dependent on the value of another covariate. However, once interactions exist, multiple parameters are always in play at the same time. Additionally, interactions can be specified for either categorical, continuous, or both types of covariates. Thus, making the interpretation of the parameters more difficult.\nWith GLMs, every covariate essentially interacts with itself because of the link function. To demonstrate parameters interacting with themselves, consider the mean of a Gaussian linear model with an identity link function\n\\[\\mu = \\alpha + \\beta x\\]\nwhere the rate of change in \\(\\mu\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is just \\(\\beta\\), i.e., the rate of change is constant no matter what the value of \\(x\\) is. But when we consider GLMs with link functions used to map outputs to exponential family distribution parameters, calculating the derivative of the mean output \\(\\mu\\) with respect to the predictor is not as straightforward as in the Gaussian linear model. For example, computing the rate of change in a binomial probability \\(p\\) with respect to \\(x\\)\n\\[p = \\frac{exp(\\alpha + \\beta x)}{1 + exp(\\alpha + \\beta x)}\\]\nAnd taking the derivative of \\(p\\) with respect to \\(x\\) yields\n\\[\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\beta}{2(1 + cosh(\\alpha + \\beta x))}\\]\nSince \\(x\\) appears in the derivative, the impact of a change in \\(x\\) depends upon \\(x\\), i.e., an interaction with itself even though no interaction term was specified in the model.Thus, visualizing the rate of change in the mean response with respect to a covariate \\(x\\) becomes a useful tool in interpreting GLMs."

The data are for an area of Arahazar Upazila, Bangladesh. The researchers labelled each well with its level of arsenic and an indication of whether the well was “safe” or “unsafe”. Those using unsafe wells were encouraged to switch. After several years, it was determined whether each household using an unsafe well had changed its well. The data contains \\(3020\\) observations on the following five variables:\n\nswitch: a factor with levels no and yes indicating whether the household switched to a new well\narsenic: the level of arsenic in the old well (measured in micrograms per liter)\ndist: the distance to the nearest safe well (measured in meters)\nassoc: a factor with levels no and yes indicating whether the household is a member of an arsenic education group\neduc: years of education of the household head\n\nFirst, a logistic regression model with no interactions is fit to the data.

In both plot_slopes and slopes, \\(w\\) and \\(c\\) are represented by wrt (with respect to) and conditional, respectively. The modeler has the ability to pass their own values for wrt and conditional by using a dictionary where the key-value pairs are the covariate and value(s) of interest.\nFor example, if we wanted to compute the slope of the probability of switching wells for a typical arsenic value of \\(1.3\\) conditional on a range of dist and educ values, we would pass the following dictionary in the code block below. By default, for \\(w\\), Bambi compares \\(w^\\text{value}\\) to \\(w^{\\text{value} + \\epsilon}\\) where \\(\\epsilon =\\) 1e-4. However, the value for \\(\\epsilon\\) can be changed by passing a value to the argument eps.\nThus, in this example, \\(w^\\text{value} = 1.3\\) and \\(w^{\\text{value} + \\epsilon} = 1.3001\\). The user is not limited to passing a list for the values. A np.array can also be used. Furthermore, Bambi by default, maps the order of the dict keys to the main, group, and panel of the matplotlib figure. Below, since dist100 is the first key, this is used for the x-axis, and educ4 is used for the group (color). If a third key was passed, it would be used for the panel (facet).\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_slopes(\n    well_model,\n    well_idata,\n    wrt={\"arsenic\": 1.3},\n    conditional={\"dist100\": [0.20, 0.50, 0.80], \"educ4\": [1.00, 1.20, 2.00]},\n)\nfig.set_size_inches(7, 3)\nfig.axes[0].set_ylabel(\"Slope of Well Switching Probability\");\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows that, for example, conditional on dist100 \\(= 0.2\\) and educ4 \\(= 1.0\\) a unit increase in arsenic is associated with households being \\(11\\)% less likely to switch wells. Notice that even though we fit a logistic regression model where the coefficients are on the log-odds scale, the slopes function returns the slope on the probability scale. Thus, we can interpret the y-axis (slope) as the expected change in the probability of switching wells for a unit increase in arsenic conditional on the specified covariates.\nslopes can be called directly to view a summary dataframe that includes the term name, estimate type (discussed in detail in the interpreting coefficients as an elasticity section), values \\(w\\) used to compute the estimate, the specified conditional covariates \\(c\\), and the expected slope of the outcome with the uncertainty interval (by default the \\(94\\)% highest density interval is computed).\n\nbmb.interpret.slopes(\n    well_model,\n    well_idata,\n    wrt={\"arsenic\": 1.5},\n    conditional={\n        \"dist100\": [0.20, 0.50, 0.80], \n        \"educ4\": [1.00, 1.20, 2.00]\n        }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nvalue\ndist100\neduc4\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.2\n1.0\n-0.110797\n-0.128775\n-0.092806\n\n\n1\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.2\n1.2\n-0.109867\n-0.126725\n-0.091065\n\n\n2\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.2\n2.0\n-0.105618\n-0.122685\n-0.088383\n\n\n3\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.5\n1.0\n-0.116087\n-0.134965\n-0.096843\n\n\n4\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.5\n1.2\n-0.115632\n-0.134562\n-0.096543\n\n\n5\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.5\n2.0\n-0.113140\n-0.130448\n-0.093209\n\n\n6\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.8\n1.0\n-0.117262\n-0.136850\n-0.098549\n\n\n7\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.8\n1.2\n-0.117347\n-0.136475\n-0.098044\n\n\n8\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.8\n2.0\n-0.116957\n-0.135079\n-0.096476\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince all covariates used to fit the model were also specified to compute the slopes, no default value is used for unspecified covariates. A default value is computed for the unspecified covariates because in order to peform predictions, Bambi is expecting a value for each covariate used to fit the model. Additionally, with GLM models, average predictive slopes are conditional in the sense that the estimate depends on the values of all the covariates in the model. Thus, for unspecified covariates, slopes and plot_slopes computes a default value (mean or mode based on the data type of the covariate). Each row in the summary dataframe is read as “the slope (or rate of change) of the probability of switching wells with respect to a small change in \\(w\\) conditional on \\(c\\) is \\(y\\)”.\n\n\nMultiple slope values\nUsers can also compute slopes on multiple values for wrt. For example, if we want to compute the slope of \\(y\\) with respect to arsenic \\(= 1.5\\), \\(2.0\\), and \\(2.5\\), simply pass a list or numpy array as the dictionary values for wrt. Keeping the conditional covariate and values the same, the following slope estimates are computed below.\n\nmultiple_values = bmb.interpret.slopes(\n    well_model,\n    well_idata,\n    wrt={\"arsenic\": [1.5, 2.0, 2.5]},\n    conditional={\n        \"dist100\": [0.20, 0.50, 0.80], \n        \"educ4\": [1.00, 1.20, 2.00]\n        }\n)\n\nmultiple_values.head(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nvalue\ndist100\neduc4\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.2\n1.0\n-0.110797\n-0.128775\n-0.092806\n\n\n1\narsenic\ndydx\n(2.0, 2.0001)\n0.2\n1.0\n-0.109867\n-0.126725\n-0.091065\n\n\n2\narsenic\ndydx\n(2.5, 2.5001)\n0.2\n1.0\n-0.105618\n-0.122685\n-0.088383\n\n\n3\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.5, 1.5001)\n0.2\n1.2\n-0.116087\n-0.134965\n-0.096843\n\n\n4\narsenic\ndydx\n(2.0, 2.0001)\n0.2\n1.2\n-0.115632\n-0.134562\n-0.096543\n\n\n5\narsenic\ndydx\n(2.5, 2.5001)\n0.2\n1.2\n-0.113140\n-0.130448\n-0.093209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above is essentially the same as the summary dataframe when we only passed one value to wrt. However, now each element (value) in the list gets a small amount \\(\\epsilon\\) added to it, and the slope is calculated for each of these values.\n\n\nConditional slopes\nAs stated in the interpreting interaction effects section, interpreting coefficients of multiple interaction terms can be difficult and cumbersome. Thus, plot_slopes provides an effective way to visualize the conditional slopes of the interaction effects. Below, we will use the same well switching dataset, but with interaction terms. Specifically, one interaction is added between dist100 and educ4, and another between arsenic and educ4.\n\nwell_model_interact = bmb.Model(\n    \"switch ~ dist100 + arsenic + educ4 + dist100:educ4 + arsenic:educ4\",\n    data,\n    family=\"bernoulli\"\n)\n\nwell_idata_interact = well_model_interact.fit(\n    draws=1000, \n    target_accept=0.95, \n    random_seed=1234, \n    chains=4\n)\n\nModeling the probability that switch==0\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [Intercept, dist100, arsenic, educ4, dist100:educ4, arsenic:educ4]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 15 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:15&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n# summary of coefficients\naz.summary(well_idata_interact)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n-0.097\n0.122\n-0.322\n0.137\n0.003\n0.002\n2259.0\n2203.0\n1.0\n\n\ndist100\n1.320\n0.175\n0.982\n1.640\n0.004\n0.003\n2085.0\n2457.0\n1.0\n\n\narsenic\n-0.398\n0.061\n-0.521\n-0.291\n0.001\n0.001\n2141.0\n2558.0\n1.0\n\n\neduc4\n0.102\n0.080\n-0.053\n0.246\n0.002\n0.001\n1935.0\n2184.0\n1.0\n\n\ndist100:educ4\n-0.330\n0.106\n-0.528\n-0.136\n0.002\n0.002\n2070.0\n2331.0\n1.0\n\n\narsenic:educ4\n-0.079\n0.043\n-0.161\n-0.000\n0.001\n0.001\n2006.0\n2348.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficients of the linear model are shown in the table above. The interaction coefficents indicate the slope varies in a continuous fashion with the continuous variable.\nA negative value for arsenic:dist100 indicates that the “effect” of arsenic on the outcome is less negative as distance from the well increases. Similarly, a negative value for arsenic:educ4 indicates that the “effect” of arsenic on the outcome is more negative as education increases. Remember, these coefficients are still on the logit scale. Furthermore, as more variables and interaction terms are added to the model, interpreting these coefficients becomes more difficult.\nThus, lets use plot_slopes to visually see how the slope changes with respect to arsenic conditional on dist100 and educ4 changing. Notice in the code block below how parameters are passed to the subplot_kwargs and fig_kwargs arguments. At times, it can be useful to pass specific group and panel arguments to aid in the interpretation of the plot. Therefore, subplot_kwargs allows the user to manipulate the plotting by passing a dictionary where the keys are {\"main\": ..., \"group\": ..., \"panel\": ...} and the values are the names of the covariates to be plotted. fig_kwargs are figure level key word arguments such as figsize and sharey.\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_slopes(\n    well_model_interact,\n    well_idata_interact,\n    wrt=\"arsenic\",\n    conditional=[\"dist100\", \"educ4\"],\n    subplot_kwargs={\"main\": \"dist100\", \"group\": \"educ4\", \"panel\": \"educ4\"},\n    fig_kwargs={\"figsize\": (16, 4), \"sharey\": True},\n    legend=False\n)\n\n\n\n\nWith interaction terms now defined, it can be seen how the slope of the outcome with respect to arsenic differ depending on the value of educ4. Especially in the case of educ4 \\(= 4.25\\), the slope is more “constant”, but with greater uncertainty. Lets compare this with the model that does not include any interaction terms.\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_slopes(\n    well_model,\n    well_idata,\n    wrt=\"arsenic\",\n    conditional=[\"dist100\", \"educ4\"],\n    subplot_kwargs={\"main\": \"dist100\", \"group\": \"educ4\", \"panel\": \"educ4\"},\n    fig_kwargs={\"figsize\": (16, 4), \"sharey\": True},\n    legend=False\n)\n\n\n\n\nFor the non-interaction model, conditional on a range of values for educ4 and dist100, the slopes of the outcome are nearly identical.\n\n\nUnit level slopes\nEvaluating average predictive slopes at central values for the conditional covariates \\(c\\) can be problematic when the inputs have a large variance since no single central value (mean, median, etc.) is representative of the covariate. This is especially true when \\(c\\) exhibits bi or multimodality. Thus, it may be desireable to use the empirical distribution of \\(c\\) to compute the predictive slopes, and then average over a specific or set of covariates to obtain average slopes. To achieve unit level slopes, do not pass a parameter into conditional and or specify None.\n\nunit_level = bmb.interpret.slopes(\n    well_model_interact,\n    well_idata_interact,\n    wrt=\"arsenic\",\n    conditional=None\n)\n\n# empirical distribution\nprint(unit_level.shape[0] == well_model_interact.data.shape[0])\nunit_level.head(10)\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nvalue\ndist100\neduc4\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\narsenic\ndydx\n(2.36, 2.3601)\n0.16826\n0.00\n-0.084280\n-0.105566\n-0.063403\n\n\n1\narsenic\ndydx\n(0.71, 0.7101)\n0.47322\n0.00\n-0.097837\n-0.125057\n-0.070959\n\n\n2\narsenic\ndydx\n(2.07, 2.0701)\n0.20967\n2.50\n-0.118093\n-0.139848\n-0.093442\n\n\n3\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.15, 1.1501)\n0.21486\n3.00\n-0.150638\n-0.194765\n-0.108946\n\n\n4\narsenic\ndydx\n(1.1, 1.1001)\n0.40874\n3.50\n-0.161272\n-0.214761\n-0.108663\n\n\n5\narsenic\ndydx\n(3.9, 3.9001)\n0.69518\n2.25\n-0.073908\n-0.080525\n-0.067493\n\n\n6\narsenic\ndydx\n(2.97, 2.9701000000000004)\n0.80711\n1.00\n-0.108482\n-0.123517\n-0.093042\n\n\n7\narsenic\ndydx\n(3.24, 3.2401000000000004)\n0.55146\n2.50\n-0.088049\n-0.097939\n-0.078020\n\n\n8\narsenic\ndydx\n(3.28, 3.2801)\n0.52647\n0.00\n-0.087388\n-0.107331\n-0.068076\n\n\n9\narsenic\ndydx\n(2.52, 2.5201000000000002)\n0.75072\n0.00\n-0.099035\n-0.129517\n-0.073222\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwell_model_interact.data.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nswitch\narsenic\ndist\nassoc\neduc\ndist100\neduc4\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n2.36\n16.826000\n0\n0\n0.16826\n0.00\n\n\n2\n1\n0.71\n47.321999\n0\n0\n0.47322\n0.00\n\n\n3\n0\n2.07\n20.966999\n0\n10\n0.20967\n2.50\n\n\n4\n1\n1.15\n21.486000\n0\n12\n0.21486\n3.00\n\n\n5\n1\n1.10\n40.874001\n1\n14\n0.40874\n3.50\n\n\n6\n1\n3.90\n69.517998\n1\n9\n0.69518\n2.25\n\n\n7\n1\n2.97\n80.710999\n1\n4\n0.80711\n1.00\n\n\n8\n1\n3.24\n55.146000\n0\n10\n0.55146\n2.50\n\n\n9\n1\n3.28\n52.646999\n1\n0\n0.52647\n0.00\n\n\n10\n1\n2.52\n75.071999\n1\n0\n0.75072\n0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, unit_level is the slopes summary dataframe and well_model_interact.data is the empirical data used to fit the model. Notice how the values for \\(c\\) are identical in both dataframes. However, for \\(w\\), the values are the original \\(w\\) value plus \\(\\epsilon\\). Thus, the estimate value represents the instantaneous rate of change for that unit of observation. However, these unit level slopes are difficult to interpret since each row may have a different slope estimate. Therefore, it is useful to average over (marginalize) the estimates to summarize the unit level predictive slopes.\n\nMarginalizing over covariates\nSince the empirical distrubution is used for computing the average predictive slopes, the same number of rows (\\(3020\\)) is returned as the data used to fit the model. To average over a covariate, use the average_by argument. If True is passed, then slopes averages over all covariates. Else, if a single or list of covariates are passed, then slopes averages by the covariates passed.\n\nbmb.interpret.slopes(\n    well_model_interact,\n    well_idata_interact,\n    wrt=\"arsenic\",\n    conditional=None,\n    average_by=True\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\narsenic\ndydx\n-0.111342\n-0.134846\n-0.088171\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code block above is equivalent to taking the mean of the estimate and uncertainty columns.

Typically, this is achieved by fitting a model where either the outcome and or the covariates are log-transformed. However, since the log transformation is performed by the modeler, to compute elasticities for slopes and plot_slopes, Bambi “post-processes” the predictions to compute the elasticities. Below, it is shown the possible elasticity arguments and how they are computed for slopes and plot_slopes:\n\neyex: a percentage point increase in \\(x_1\\) is associated with an \\(n\\) percentage point increase in \\(y\\)\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial x_1} * \\frac{x_1}{\\hat{y}}\\]\n\neydx: a unit increase in \\(x_1\\) is associated with an \\(n\\) percentage point increase in \\(y\\)\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial x_1} * \\frac{1}{\\hat{y}}\\]\n\ndyex: a percentage point increase in \\(x_1\\) is associated with an \\(n\\) unit increase in \\(y\\)\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial x_1} * x_1\\]\nBelow, each code cell shows the same model, and wrt and conditional argument, but with a different elasticity (slope) argument. By default, dydx (a derivative with no post-processing) is used.\n\nbmb.interpret.slopes(\n    well_model_interact,\n    well_idata_interact,\n    wrt=\"arsenic\",\n    slope=\"eyex\",\n    conditional=None,\n    average_by=True\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\narsenic\neyex\n-0.525124\n-0.652708\n-0.396082\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbmb.interpret.slopes(\n    well_model_interact,\n    well_idata_interact,\n    wrt=\"arsenic\",\n    slope=\"eydx\",\n    conditional=None,\n    average_by=True\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\narsenic\neydx\n-0.286753\n-0.351592\n-0.220459\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbmb.interpret.slopes(\n    well_model_interact,\n    well_idata_interact,\n    wrt=\"arsenic\",\n    slope=\"dyex\",\n    conditional=None,\n    average_by=True\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\narsenic\ndyex\n-0.167616\n-0.201147\n-0.134605\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nslope is also an argument for plot_slopes. Below, we visualize the elasticity with respect to arsenic conditional on a range of dist100 and educ4 values (notice this is the same plot as in the conditional slopes section).\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_slopes(\n    well_model_interact,\n    well_idata_interact,\n    wrt=\"arsenic\",\n    conditional=[\"dist100\", \"educ4\"],\n    slope=\"eyex\",\n    subplot_kwargs={\"main\": \"dist100\", \"group\": \"educ4\", \"panel\": \"educ4\"},\n    fig_kwargs={\"figsize\": (16, 4), \"sharey\": True},\n    legend=False\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical covariates\nAs mentioned in the computing slopes section, if you pass a variable with a string or categorical data type, the comparisons function will be called to compute the expected difference in group means. Here, we fit the same interaction model as above, albeit, by specifying educ4 as an ordinal data type.\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/arsenic/wells.dat\", sep=\" \")\ndata[\"switch\"] = pd.Categorical(data[\"switch\"])\ndata[\"dist100\"] = data[\"dist\"] / 100\ndata[\"educ4\"] = pd.Categorical(data[\"educ\"] / 4, ordered=True)\n\n\nwell_model_interact = bmb.Model(\n    \"switch ~ dist100 + arsenic + educ4 + dist100:educ4 + arsenic:educ4\",\n    data,\n    family=\"bernoulli\"\n)\n\nwell_idata_interact = well_model_interact.fit(\n    draws=1000, \n    target_accept=0.95, \n    random_seed=1234, \n    chains=4\n)\n\nModeling the probability that switch==0\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [Intercept, dist100, arsenic, educ4, dist100:educ4, arsenic:educ4]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 319 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 05:18&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_slopes(\n    well_model_interact,\n    well_idata_interact,\n    wrt=\"educ4\",\n    conditional=\"dist100\",\n    average_by=\"dist100\"\n)\nfig.set_size_inches(7, 3)\n\n\n\n\nAs the model was fit with educ4 as a categorical data type, Bambi recognized this, and calls comparisons to compute the differences between each level of educ4. As educ4 contains many category levels, a covariate must be passed to average_by in order to perform plotting. Below, we can see this plot is equivalent to plot_comparisons.\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_comparisons(\n    well_model_interact,\n    well_idata_interact,\n    contrast=\"educ4\",\n    conditional=\"dist100\",\n    average_by=\"dist100\"\n)\nfig.set_size_inches(7, 3)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, computing the predictive difference between each educ4 level may not be desired. Thus, in plot_slopes, as in plot_comparisons, if wrt is a categorical or string data type, it is possible to specify the wrt values. For example, if we wanted to compute the expected difference in probability of switching wells for when educ4 is \\(4\\) versus \\(1\\) conditional on a range of dist100 and arsenic values, we would pass the following dictionary in the code block below.

    "text": "We don’t know the real posterior so we are going to choose a distribution \\(Q(\\theta)\\) from a family of distributions \\(Q^*\\) that are easy to work with and parameterized by \\(\\theta\\). The approximate distribution should be as close as possible to the true posterior. This closeness is measured using KL-Divergence. If we have the joint \\(p(x, z)\\) where \\(x\\) is some observed data, the goal is to perform inference: given what we have observed, what can we infer about the latent states?, i.e , we want the posterior.\nRecall Bayes theorem:\n\\[p(z | x) = \\frac{p(x|z)p(z)}{p(x)}\\]\nThe problem is the marginal \\(p(x = D)\\) as this could require a hundred, thousand, . . .dimensional integral:\n\\[p(x) = \\int_{z_0},...,\\int_{z_{D-1}}p(x, z)dz_0,...,d_{z_D{-1}}\\]\nIf we want the full posterior and can’t compute the marginal, then what’s the solution? Surrogate posterior. We want to approximate the true posterior using some known distribution:\n\\[q(z) \\approx p(z|X=D)\\]\nwhere \\(\\approx\\) can mean you want the approximated posterior to be “as good as possible”. Using variational inference, the objective is to minimize the distance between the surrogate \\(q(z)\\) and the true posterior \\(p(x)\\) using KL-Divergence:\n\\[q^*(z) = argmin_{q(z) \\in Q} (KL(q(z) || p(z|x=D)))\\]\nwhere \\(Q\\) is a more “simple” distribution. We can restate the KL-divergence as the expectation:\n\\[KL(q(z) || p(z|D)) = \\mathbb{E_{z \\sim q(z)}}[log \\frac{q(z)}{p(z|D)}]\\]\nwhich, taking the expectation over \\(z\\), is equivalent to integration:\n\\[\\int_{z_0}, . . .,\\int_{z_{D-1}}q(z)log\\frac{q(z)}{p(z|D)}d_{z_0},...,d_{z_{D-1}}\\]\nBut, sadly we don’t have \\(p(z \\vert D)\\) as this is the posterior! We only have the joint. Solution? Recall our KL-divergence:\n\\[KL(q(z) || p(z|D))\\]\nWe can rearrange the terms inside the \\(log\\) so that we can actually compute something:\n\\[\\int_{z}q(z)log(\\frac{q(z)p(D)}{p(z, D)})dz\\]\nWe only have the joint. Not the posterior; nor the marginal. We know from Bayes rule that we can express the posterior in terms of the joint \\(p(z, D)\\) divided by the marginal \\(p(x=D)\\):\n\\[p(z|D) = \\frac{p(Z, D)}{p(D)}\\]\nWe plug this inside of the \\(log\\):\n\\[\\int_{z}q(z)log(\\frac{q(z)p(D)}{p(z, D)})dz\\]\nHowever, the problem now is that we have reformulated our problem into another quantity that we don’t have, i.e., the marginal \\(p(D)\\). But we can put the quantity that we don’t have outside of the \\(log\\) to form two separate integrals.\n\\[\\int_z q(z)log(\\frac{q(z)}{p(z, D)})dz + \\int_zq(z)log(p(D)dz\\]\nThis is a valid rearrangement because of the properties of logarithms. In this case, the numerator is a product, so this turns into a sum of the second integral. What do we see in these two terms? We see an expectation over the quantity \\(\\frac{q(z)}{p(z, D)}\\) and another expectation over \\(p(D)\\). Rewriting in terms of expectation:\n\\[\\mathbb{E_{z{\\sim q(z)}}}[log(\\frac{q(z)}{p(z, D)})] + \\mathbb{E_{z \\sim q(z)}}[log(p(D))]\\]\nThe right term contains information we know—the functional form of the surrogate \\(q(z)\\) and the joint \\(p(z, D)\\) (in the form of a directed graphical model). We still don’t have access to \\(p(D)\\) on the right side, but this is a constant quantity. The expectation of a quantity that does not contain \\(z\\) is just whatever the expectation was taken over. Because of this, we can again rearrange:\n\\[-\\mathbb{E_{z \\sim q(z)}}[log \\frac{p(z, D)}{q(z)}]+log (p(D))\\]\nThe minus sign is a result of the “swapping” of the numerator and denominator and is required to make it a valid change. Looking at this, the left side is a function dependent on \\(q\\). In shorthand form, we can call this \\(\\mathcal{L(q)}\\). Our KL-divergence is:\n\\[KL = \\mathcal{-L(q)} + \\underbrace{log(p(D))}_\\textrm{evidence}\\]\nwhere \\(p(D)\\) is a value between \\([0, 1]\\) and this value is called the evidence which is the log probability of the data. If we apply the \\(log\\) to something between \\([0, 1]\\) then this value will be negative. This value is also constant since we have observed the dataset and thus does not change.\n\\(KL\\) is the distance (between the posterior and the surrogate) so it must be something positive. If the \\(KL\\) is positive and the evidence is negative, then in order to fulfill this equation, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must also be negative (negative times a negative is a positive). The \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) should be smaller than the evidence, and thus it is called the lower bound of the evidence \\(\\rightarrow\\) Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).\nAgain, ELBO is defined as: \\(\\mathcal{L} = \\mathbb{E_{z \\sim q(z)}}[log(\\frac{p(z, D)}{q(z)})]\\) and is important to note that the ELBO is equal to the evidence if and only if the KL-divergence between the surrogate and the true posterior is \\(0\\):\n\\[\\mathcal{L(q)} = log(p(D)) \\textrm{ i.f.f. } KL(q(z)||p(z|D))=0\\]"

According to the original deliverables table outlined in my proposal, the goal was to have opened a draft PR for the core functionality of the plot_comparisons. Subsequently, week six and seven were to be spent further developing the plot_comparisons function, and writing tests and a demo notebook for the documentation, respectively. However, at the end of week five, I have a PR open with the majority of the functionality that marginaleffects has. In addition, I also exposed the comparisons function, added tests (which can and will be improved), and have started on documentation."

    "section": "Average Predictive Differences",
    "text": "Average Predictive Differences\nHere, we adopt the notation from Chapter 14.4 of Regression and Other Stories to describe average predictive differences. Assume we have fit a Bambi model predicting an outcome \\(Y\\) based on inputs \\(X\\) and parameters \\(\\theta\\). Consider the following scalar inputs:\n\\[w: \\text{the input of interest}\\] \\[c: \\text{all the other inputs}\\] \\[X = (w, c)\\]\nSuppose for the input of interest, we are interested in comparing \\(w^{\\text{high}}\\) to \\(w^{\\text{low}}\\) (perhaps age = \\(60\\) and \\(40\\) respectively) with all other inputs \\(c\\) held constant. The predictive difference in the outcome changing only \\(w\\) is:\n\\[\\text{average predictive difference} = \\mathbb{E}(y|w^{\\text{high}}, c, \\theta) - \\mathbb{E}(y|w^{\\text{low}}, c, \\theta)\\]\nSelecting the maximum and minimum values of \\(w\\) and averaging over all other inputs \\(c\\) in the data gives you a new “hypothetical” dataset and corresponds to counting all pairs of transitions of \\((w^\\text{low})\\) to \\((w^\\text{high})\\), i.e., differences in \\(w\\) with \\(c\\) held constant. The difference between these two terms is the average predictive difference.\n\nComputing Average Predictive Differences\nThe objective of comparisons and plot_comparisons is to compute the expected difference in the outcome corresponding to three different scenarios for \\(w\\) and \\(c\\) where \\(w\\) is either provided by the user, else a default value is computed by Bambi (described in the default values section). The three scenarios are:\n\nuser provided values for \\(c\\).\na grid of equally spaced and central values for \\(c\\).\nempirical distribution (original data used to fit the model) for \\(c\\).\n\nIn the case of (1) and (2) above, Bambi assembles all pairwise combinations (transitions) of \\(w\\) and \\(c\\) into a new “hypothetical” dataset. In (3), Bambi uses the original \\(c\\), but replaces \\(w\\) with the user provided value or the default value computed by Bambi. In each scenario, predictions are made on the data using the fitted model. Once the predictions are made, comparisons are computed using the posterior samples by taking the difference in the predicted outcome for each pair of transitions. The average of these differences is the average predictive difference.\nThus, the goal of comparisons and plot_comparisons is to provide the modeler with a summary and visualization of the average predictive difference. Below, we demonstrate how to compute and plot average predictive differences with comparisons and plot_comparions using several examples.\n\nimport arviz as az\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport bambi as bmb"

    "text": "Zero Inflated Poisson\nWe model and predict how many fish are caught by visitors at a state park using survey data. Many visitors catch zero fish, either because they did not fish at all, or because they were unlucky. We would like to explicitly model this bimodal behavior (zero versus non-zero) using a Zero Inflated Poisson model, and to compare how different inputs of interest \\(w\\) and other covariate values \\(c\\) are associated with the number of fish caught. The dataset contains data on 250 groups that went to a state park to fish. Each group was questioned about how many fish they caught (count), how many children were in the group (child), how many people were in the group (persons), if they used a live bait and whether or not they brought a camper to the park (camper).\n\nfish_data = pd.read_stata(\"http://www.stata-press.com/data/r11/fish.dta\")\ncols = [\"count\", \"livebait\", \"camper\", \"persons\", \"child\"]\nfish_data = fish_data[cols]\nfish_data[\"livebait\"] = pd.Categorical(fish_data[\"livebait\"])\nfish_data[\"camper\"] = pd.Categorical(fish_data[\"camper\"])\n\n\nfish_model = bmb.Model(\n    \"count ~ livebait + camper + persons + child\", \n    fish_data, \n    family='zero_inflated_poisson'\n)\n\nfish_idata = fish_model.fit(\n    draws=1000, \n    target_accept=0.95, \n    random_seed=1234, \n    chains=4\n)\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [count_psi, Intercept, livebait, camper, persons, child]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 4 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:03&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nUser Provided Values\nFirst, an example of scenario 1 (user provided values) is given below. In both plot_comparisons and comparisons, \\(w\\) and \\(c\\) are represented by contrast and conditional, respectively. The modeler has the ability to pass their own values for contrast and conditional by using a dictionary where the key-value pairs are the covariate and value(s) of interest. For example, if we wanted to compare the number of fish caught for \\(4\\) versus \\(1\\) persons conditional on a range of child and livebait values, we would pass the following dictionary in the code block below. By default, for \\(w\\), Bambi compares \\(w^\\text{high}\\) to \\(w^\\text{low}\\). Thus, in this example, \\(w^\\text{high}\\) = 4 and \\(w^\\text{low}\\) = 1. The user is not limited to passing a list for the values. A np.array can also be used. Furthermore, Bambi by default, maps the order of the dict keys to the main, group, and panel of the matplotlib figure. Below, since child is the first key, this is used for the x-axis, and livebait is used for the group (color). If a third key was passed, it would be used for the panel (facet).\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_comparisons(\n    model=fish_model,\n    idata=fish_idata,\n    contrast={\"persons\": [1, 4]},\n    conditional={\"child\": [0, 1, 2], \"livebait\": [0, 1]},\n) \nfig.set_size_inches(7, 3)\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows that, comparing \\(4\\) to \\(1\\) persons given \\(0\\) children and using livebait, the expected difference is about \\(26\\) fish. When not using livebait, the expected difference decreases substantially to about \\(5\\) fish. Using livebait with a group of people is associated with a much larger expected difference in the number of fish caught.\ncomparisons can be called to view a summary dataframe that includes the term \\(w\\) and its contrast, the specified conditional covariate, and the expected difference in the outcome with the uncertainty interval (by default the 94% highest density interval is computed).\n\nbmb.interpret.comparisons(\n    model=fish_model,\n    idata=fish_idata,\n    contrast={\"persons\": [1, 4]},\n    conditional={\"child\": [0, 1, 2], \"livebait\": [0, 1]},\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nvalue\nchild\nlivebait\ncamper\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\npersons\ndiff\n(1.0, 4.0)\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n4.834472\n2.563472\n7.037150\n\n\n1\npersons\ndiff\n(1.0, 4.0)\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n26.423188\n23.739729\n29.072748\n\n\n2\npersons\ndiff\n(1.0, 4.0)\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.202003\n0.631629\n1.780965\n\n\n3\npersons\ndiff\n(1.0, 4.0)\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n6.571943\n5.469275\n7.642248\n\n\n4\npersons\ndiff\n(1.0, 4.0)\n2.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.301384\n0.143676\n0.467608\n\n\n5\npersons\ndiff\n(1.0, 4.0)\n2.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.648417\n1.140415\n2.187190\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut why is camper also in the summary dataframe? This is because in order to peform predictions, Bambi is expecting a value for each covariate used to fit the model. Additionally, with GLM models, average predictive comparisons are conditional in the sense that the estimate depends on the values of all the covariates in the model. Thus, for unspecified covariates, comparisons and plot_comparisons computes a default value (mean or mode based on the data type of the covariate). Thus, \\(c\\) = child, livebait, camper. Each row in the summary dataframe is read as “comparing \\(4\\) to \\(1\\) persons conditional on \\(c\\), the expected difference in the outcome is \\(y\\).”\n\n\nMultiple contrast values\nUsers can also perform comparisons on multiple contrast values. For example, if we wanted to compare the number of fish caught between \\((1, 2)\\), \\((1, 4)\\), and \\((2, 4)\\) persons conditional on a range of values for child and livebait.\n\nmultiple_values = bmb.interpret.comparisons(\n    model=fish_model,\n    idata=fish_idata,\n    contrast={\"persons\": [1, 2, 4]},\n    conditional={\"child\": [0, 1, 2], \"livebait\": [0, 1]}\n)\n\nmultiple_values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nvalue\nchild\nlivebait\ncamper\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 2)\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.527627\n0.295451\n0.775465\n\n\n1\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 2)\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n2.883694\n2.605690\n3.177685\n\n\n2\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 2)\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.131319\n0.067339\n0.195132\n\n\n3\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 2)\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.717965\n0.592968\n0.857893\n\n\n4\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 2)\n2.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.032960\n0.015212\n0.052075\n\n\n5\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 2)\n2.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.180270\n0.123173\n0.244695\n\n\n6\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 4)\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n4.834472\n2.563472\n7.037150\n\n\n7\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 4)\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n26.423188\n23.739729\n29.072748\n\n\n8\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 4)\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.202003\n0.631629\n1.780965\n\n\n9\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 4)\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n6.571943\n5.469275\n7.642248\n\n\n10\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 4)\n2.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.301384\n0.143676\n0.467608\n\n\n11\npersons\ndiff\n(1, 4)\n2.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.648417\n1.140415\n2.187190\n\n\n12\npersons\ndiff\n(2, 4)\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n4.306845\n2.267097\n6.280005\n\n\n13\npersons\ndiff\n(2, 4)\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n23.539494\n20.990931\n26.240169\n\n\n14\npersons\ndiff\n(2, 4)\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.070683\n0.565931\n1.585718\n\n\n15\npersons\ndiff\n(2, 4)\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n5.853978\n4.858957\n6.848519\n\n\n16\npersons\ndiff\n(2, 4)\n2.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.268423\n0.124033\n0.412274\n\n\n17\npersons\ndiff\n(2, 4)\n2.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.468147\n1.024800\n1.960934\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the contrast \\(w\\) varies while the covariates \\(c\\) are held constant. Currently, however, plotting multiple contrast values can be difficult to interpret since the contrast is “abstracted” away onto the y-axis. Thus, it would be difficult to interpret which portion of the plot corresponds to which contrast value. Therefore, it is currently recommended that if you want to plot multiple contrast values, call comparisons directly to obtain the summary dataframe and plot the results yourself.\n\n\nDefault contrast and conditional values\nNow, we move onto scenario 2 described above (grid of equally spaced and central values) in computing average predictive comparisons. You are not required to pass values for contrast and conditional. If you do not pass values, Bambi will compute default values for you. Below, it is described how these default values are computed.\nThe default value for contrast is a centered difference at the mean for a contrast variable with a numeric dtype, and unique levels for a contrast varaible with a categorical dtype. For example, if the modeler is interested in the comparison of a \\(5\\) unit increase in \\(w\\) where \\(w\\) is a numeric variable, Bambi computes the mean and then subtracts and adds \\(2.5\\) units to the mean to obtain a centered difference. By default, if no value is passed for the contrast covariate, Bambi computes a one unit centered difference at the mean. For example, if only contrast=\"persons\" is passed, then \\(\\pm\\) \\(0.5\\) is applied to the mean of persons. If \\(w\\) is a categorical variable, Bambi computes and returns the unique levels. For example, if \\(w\\) has levels [“high scool”, “vocational”, “university”], Bambi computes and returns the unique values of this variable.\nThe default values for conditional are more involved. Currently, by default, if a dict or list is passed to conditional, Bambi uses the ordering (keys if dict and elements if list) to determine which covariate to use as the main, group (color), and panel (facet) variable. This is the same logic used in plot_comparisons described above. Subsequently, the default values used for the conditional covariates depend on their ordering and dtype. Below, the psuedocode used for computing default values covariates passed to conditional is outlined:\nif v == \"main\":\n    \n    if v == numeric:\n        return np.linspace(v.min(), v.max(), 50)\n    elif v == categorical:\n        return np.unique(v)\n\nelif v == \"group\":\n    \n    if v == numeric:\n        return np.quantile(v, np.linspace(0, 1, 5))\n    elif v == categorical:\n        return np.unique(v)\n\nelif v == \"panel\":\n    \n    if v == numeric:\n        return np.quantile(v, np.linspace(0, 1, 5))\n    elif v == categorical:\n        return np.unique(v)\nThus, letting Bambi compute default values for conditional is equivalent to creating a hypothetical “data grid” of new values. Lets say we are interested in comparing the number of fish caught for the contrast livebait conditional on persons and child. This time, lets call comparisons first to gain an understanding of the data generating the plot.\n\ncontrast_df = bmb.interpret.comparisons(\n    model=fish_model,\n    idata=fish_idata,\n    contrast=\"livebait\",\n    conditional=[\"persons\", \"child\"],\n)\n\ncontrast_df.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nvalue\npersons\nchild\ncamper\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.000000\n0.0\n1.0\n1.694646\n1.252803\n2.081207\n\n\n1\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.000000\n1.0\n1.0\n0.422448\n0.299052\n0.551766\n\n\n2\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.000000\n3.0\n1.0\n0.026923\n0.012752\n0.043035\n\n\n3\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.061224\n0.0\n1.0\n1.787412\n1.342979\n2.203158\n\n\n4\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.061224\n1.0\n1.0\n0.445555\n0.317253\n0.580117\n\n\n5\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.061224\n3.0\n1.0\n0.028393\n0.013452\n0.045276\n\n\n6\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.122449\n0.0\n1.0\n1.885270\n1.422937\n2.313218\n\n\n7\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.122449\n1.0\n1.0\n0.469929\n0.335373\n0.609249\n\n\n8\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.122449\n3.0\n1.0\n0.029944\n0.014165\n0.047593\n\n\n9\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.183674\n0.0\n1.0\n1.988500\n1.501650\n2.424762\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs livebait was encoded as a categorical dtype, Bambi returned the unique levels of \\([0, 1]\\) for the contrast. persons and child were passed as the first and second element and thus act as the main and group variables, respectively. It can be see from the output above, that an equally spaced grid was used to compute the values for persons, whereas a quantile based grid was used for child. Furthermore, as camper was unspecified, the mode was used as the default value. Lets go ahead and plot the commparisons.\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_comparisons(\n    model=fish_model,\n    idata=fish_idata,\n    contrast=\"livebait\",\n    conditional=[\"persons\", \"child\"],\n) \nfig.set_size_inches(7, 3)\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows us that the expected differences in fish caught comparing a group of people who use livebait and no livebait is not only conditional on the number of persons, but also children. However, the plotted comparisons for child = \\(3\\) is difficult to interpret on a single plot. Thus, it can be useful to pass specific group and panel arguments to aid in the interpretation of the plot. Therefore, subplot_kwargs allows the user to manipulate the plotting by passing a dictionary where the keys are {\"main\": ..., \"group\": ..., \"panel\": ...} and the values are the names of the covariates to be plotted. Below, we plot the same comparisons as above, but this time we specify group and panel to both be child.\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_comparisons(\n    model=fish_model,\n    idata=fish_idata,\n    contrast=\"livebait\",\n    conditional=[\"persons\", \"child\"],\n    subplot_kwargs={\"main\": \"persons\", \"group\": \"child\", \"panel\": \"child\"},\n    fig_kwargs={\"figsize\":(12, 3), \"sharey\": True},\n    legend=False\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit level contrasts\nEvaluating average predictive comparisons at central values for the conditional covariates \\(c\\) can be problematic when the inputs have a large variance since no single central value (mean, median, etc.) is representative of the covariate. This is especially true when \\(c\\) exhibits bi or multimodality. Thus, it may be desireable to use the empirical distribution of \\(c\\) to compute the predictive comparisons, and then average over a specific or set of covariates to obtain the average predictive comparisons. To achieve unit level contrasts, do not pass a parameter into conditional and or specify None.\n\nunit_level = bmb.interpret.comparisons(\n    model=fish_model,\n    idata=fish_idata,\n    contrast=\"livebait\",\n    conditional=None,\n)\n\n# empirical distribution\nprint(unit_level.shape[0] == fish_model.data.shape[0])\nunit_level.head(10)\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nvalue\ncamper\nchild\npersons\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.864408\n0.627063\n1.116105\n\n\n1\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.694646\n1.252803\n2.081207\n\n\n2\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.864408\n0.627063\n1.116105\n\n\n3\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.0\n1.0\n2.0\n1.009094\n0.755449\n1.249551\n\n\n4\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.864408\n0.627063\n1.116105\n\n\n5\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.0\n2.0\n4.0\n1.453235\n0.964674\n1.956434\n\n\n6\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n0.0\n1.0\n3.0\n1.233247\n0.900295\n1.569891\n\n\n7\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n0.0\n3.0\n4.0\n0.188019\n0.090328\n0.289560\n\n\n8\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n0.606361\n0.390571\n0.818549\n\n\n9\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.694646\n1.252803\n2.081207\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# empirical (observed) data used to fit the model\nfish_model.data.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\nlivebait\ncamper\npersons\nchild\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\n1\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\n2\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\n3\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n2.0\n1.0\n\n\n4\n1.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\n5\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n4.0\n2.0\n\n\n6\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n3.0\n1.0\n\n\n7\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n4.0\n3.0\n\n\n8\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n3.0\n2.0\n\n\n9\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, unit_level is the comparisons summary dataframe and fish_model.data is the empirical data. Notice how the values for \\(c\\) are identical in both dataframes. However, for \\(w\\), the values are different. However, these unit level contrasts are difficult to interpret as each row corresponds to that unit’s contrast. Therefore, it is useful to average over (marginalize) the estimates to summarize the unit level predictive comparisons.\n\nMarginalizing over covariates\nSince the empirical distrubution is used for computing the average predictive comparisons, the same number of rows (250) is returned as the data used to fit the model. To average over a covariate, use the average_by argument. If True is passed, then comparisons averages over all covariates. Else, if a single or list of covariates are passed, then comparisons averages by the covariates passed.\n\n# marginalize over all covariates\nbmb.interpret.comparisons(\n    model=fish_model,\n    idata=fish_idata,\n    contrast=\"livebait\",\n    conditional=None,\n    average_by=True\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate_type\nvalue\nestimate\nlower_3.0%\nupper_97.0%\n\n\n\n\n0\nlivebait\ndiff\n(0.0, 1.0)\n3.649691\n2.956185\n4.333621\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing True to average_by averages over all covariates and is equivalent to taking the mean of the estimate and uncertainty columns.

    "text": "Logistic Regression\nTo showcase an additional functionality of comparisons and plot_comparisons, we fit a logistic regression model to the titanic dataset with interaction terms to model the probability of survival. The titanic dataset gives the values of four categorical attributes for each of the 2201 people on board the Titanic when it struck an iceberg and sank. The attributes are social class (first class, second class, third class, crewmember), age, sex (0 = female, 1 = male), and whether or not the person survived (0 = deceased, 1 = survived).\n\ndat = pd.read_csv(\"https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Titanic.csv\", index_col=0)\n\ndat[\"PClass\"] = dat[\"PClass\"].str.replace(\"[st, nd, rd]\", \"\", regex=True)\ndat[\"PClass\"] = dat[\"PClass\"].str.replace(\"*\", \"0\").astype(int)\ndat[\"PClass\"] = dat[\"PClass\"].replace(0, np.nan)\ndat[\"PClass\"] = pd.Categorical(dat[\"PClass\"], ordered=True)\ndat[\"SexCode\"] = pd.Categorical(dat[\"SexCode\"], ordered=True)\n\ndat = dat.dropna(axis=0, how=\"any\")\n\n\ntitanic_model = bmb.Model(\n    \"Survived ~ PClass * SexCode * Age\", \n    data=dat, \n    family=\"bernoulli\"\n)\ntitanic_idata = titanic_model.fit(draws=1000, target_accept=0.95, random_seed=1234)\n\nModeling the probability that Survived==1\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [Intercept, PClass, SexCode, PClass:SexCode, Age, PClass:Age, SexCode:Age, PClass:SexCode:Age]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 16 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:15&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nComparison types\ncomparisons and plot_comparisons also allow you to specify the type of comparison to be computed. By default, a difference is used. However, it is also possible to take the ratio where comparisons would then become average predictive ratios. To achieve this, pass \"ratio\" into the argument comparison_type. Using different comparison types offers a way to produce alternative insights; especially when there are interaction terms as the value of one covariate depends on the value of the other covariate.\n\nfig, ax = bmb.interpret.plot_comparisons(\n    model=titanic_model,\n    idata=titanic_idata,\n    contrast={\"PClass\": [1, 3]},\n    conditional=[\"Age\", \"SexCode\"],\n    comparison_type=\"ratio\",\n    subplot_kwargs={\"main\": \"Age\", \"group\": \"SexCode\", \"panel\": \"SexCode\"},\n    fig_kwargs={\"figsize\":(12, 3), \"sharey\": True},\n    legend=False\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe left panel shows that the ratio of the probability of survival comparing PClass \\(3\\) to \\(1\\) conditional on Age is non-constant. Whereas the right panel shows an approximately constant ratio in the probability of survival comparing PClass \\(3\\) to \\(1\\) conditional on Age.\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, solid progress has been made with comparisons and plot_comparisons to give the Bambi modeller insights into GLMs. One of the most difficult aspects to program is the building of the contrast dataframe (the output above) as it requires tedious shape handling to ensure the predictive comparisons are “mapped” to the correct contrast and conditional values. Writing better tests to ensure shapes are correct is something I am also working on. Additionally, there are still “nice to have” features such as:\n\ncross-contrasts\ncomparisons other than the predictive difference or ratios (e.g., adjusted risk ratio)"

    "text": "Switching Costs, Dependency and Open Source Goods\nAt least the two lower levels of abstractions usually rely on open-source software, whereas the no-code alternative is typically (at the moment) proprietary technology in the form of machine learning as a service and or platform. [Edit 14.09.2021: H20.ai, HuggingFace, MakeML, CreateML, Google Cloud AutoML are all open-source services or platforms in the low or no code ML space] Open-source gives you the biggest flexibility that, if the space again changes, you can move things. Otherwise, you find yourself locked into a technology stack the way you were locked in to technologies from the ’80s and ’90s and 2000s.\nBeing locked into IT components can have serious opportunity costs. For example, switching from Mac to a Windows based PC involves not only the hardware costs of the computer itself, but also involves purchasing of a whole new library of software, and even more importantly, learning how to use a brand new system. When you, or an organization, decides to go the propriety route, these switching costs can be very high, and users may find themselves experiencing lock-in; a situation where the cost of changing to a different system is so high that switching is virtually inconcievable.\nOf course, the producers of this hardware / sofware love the fact that you have an inelastic demand curve - a rise in prices won’t affect demand much as switching costs are high. In summary, as machine learning platforms didn’t really exist ~15 years ago, they will more than likely change quite a bit and you are dependent on the producer of continually adapting to industry trends and technological advancements while at the same time, staying flexible to cater to your edge cases when you need it."

Before AWS, APIs, open source, etc., as an organization or startup, it was likely the question, “we need amazing technical people who can build it all”. Now, with the increase and rise of PaaS, SaaS, open source librarys and tooling, the question shifts from a question of “building”, to a question of “leveraging existing tools”. How long before no / low code gets good enough before we are asking, “why did we not build this with no-code tools?”.\nThe highest form of leverage for a company is to develop and build out difficult and new technology. No-code, if developed right (and is ideally open-source), can still provide leverage and value-add, but any advantage just becomes table stakes. This is what will distinguish great teams vs. good teams; non-linear returns will continue to be through building out proprietery and difficult technology."

    "title": "Using Alternative Samplers in Bambi",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This blog post is a copy of the zero inflated models documentation I wrote for Bambi. The original post can be found here.\nIn Bambi, the sampler used is automatically selected given the type of variables used in the model. For inference, Bambi supports both MCMC and variational inference. By default, Bambi uses PyMC’s implementation of the adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for sampling. Also known as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). This sampler is a good choice for many models. However, it is not the only sampling method, nor is PyMC the only library implementing NUTS.\nTo this extent, Bambi supports multiple backends for MCMC sampling such as NumPyro and Blackjax. This notebook will cover how to use such alternatives in Bambi.\nNote: Bambi utilizes bayeux to access a variety of sampling backends. Thus, you will need to install the optional dependencies in the Bambi pyproject.toml file to use these backends.\n\nimport arviz as az\nimport bambi as bmb\nimport bayeux as bx\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\n\nBambi leverages bayeux to access different sampling backends. In short, bayeux lets you write a probabilistic model in JAX and immediately have access to state-of-the-art inference methods.\nSince the underlying Bambi model is a PyMC model, this PyMC model can be “given” to bayeux.

For the design of the plots sub-package, I decided to create five different modules, each with a specific purpose. The modules are as follows:\n\ncreate_data.py - creates the data called by the functions in the effects.py and comparisons.py modules.\neffects.py - contains the functions (predictions, comparisons, slopes) that are used to create the dataframe that is passed to the plotting functions and or user when called standalone.\nutils.py - contains commonly used functions that are called by multiple modules in the plots sub-package.\nplotting.py - contains the plotting functions (plot_predictions, plot_comparisons, plot_slopes) that are used to generate the plots for the user.\nplot_types.py - determines the plot types (numeric or categorical) for the the plotting module.\n\nThe modularization of the plots sub-package will allow for easier maintenance and testing of the codebase and offers re-usability of code using OOP principles. The modularization of code happened during the initial development stages of the plot_comparisons function."

    "text": "This code complements the figures and methods described in Chapter 4: A Fragment of the Sphinx of the book Shape: The Hidden Geometry of Everything by Jordan Ellenberg. In 1897, Sir Ronald Ross had discovered that maleria was carried by the bite of the anopheles mosquito. In the late summer of 1904, he gave a lecture in Missouri, United States titled “The Logical Basis of Sanitary Policy of Mosquito Reduction”. This lecture contained the first glimmer into a new geometric theory that would explode into physics, finance, and many other areas of science and engineering: the random walk.\nRoss proposed you eliminate propogation of mosquitos in a circular region by draining the pools where they breed. That doesn’t eliminate all potentially malarial mosquitoes from the region, because others may be born outside the circle and fly in. But, the mosquitoes’ life is brief and lacks ambition; it won’t set a course straight for the center and stick to it. So, some region around the center of the circle would hopefully be malaria free, as long as the circle is large enough. How large is large enough? That depends on how far a mosquito is likely to travel.\n“Suppose that a mosquito is born at a given point, and that during its life it wanders about, to or fro, to left or to right, where it wills…After a time it will die. What are the probabilities that its dead body will be found at a given distance from its birthplace?”"
