      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, AI is primarily associated with LLMs, where the goal is to develop autonomous agents with human-level intelligence (whatever that means). I have always found the goal of creating something with &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; boring for some reason. Maybe it is because the objective is too diffuseâ€”create something at least as smart as humans and hope it figures out $x$. Regardless, LLM-based agents are useful tools and I use them as such, but these systems are a narrow view of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
