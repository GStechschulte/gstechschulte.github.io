  "articleBody": "We don’t know the real posterior so we are going to choose a distribution $Q(\\theta)$ from a family of distributions $Q^*$ that are easy to work with and parameterized by $\\theta$. The approximate distribution should be as close as possible to the true posterior. This closeness is measured using KL-Divergence. If we have the joint $p(x, z)$ where $x$ is some observed data, the goal is to perform inference: given what we have observed, what can we infer about the latent states?, i.e , we want the posterior.\nRecall Bayes theorem:\n$$p(z | x) = \\frac{p(x|z)p(z)}{p(x)}$$\nThe problem is the marginal $p(x = D)$ as this could require a hundred, thousand, . . .dimensional integral:\n$$p(x) = \\int_{z_0},…,\\int_{z_{D-1}}p(x, z)dz_0,…,d_{z_D{-1}}$$\nIf we want the full posterior and can’t compute the marginal, then what’s the solution? Surrogate posterior. We want to approximate the true posterior using some known distribution:\n$$q(z) \\approx p(z|X=D)$$\nwhere $\\approx$ can mean you want the approximated posterior to be “as good as possible”. Using variational inference, the objective is to minimize the distance between the surrogate $q(z)$ and the true posterior $p(x)$ using KL-Divergence:\n$$q^*(z) = argmin_{q(z) \\in Q} (KL(q(z) || p(z|x=D)))$$\nwhere $Q$ is a more “simple” distribution. We can restate the KL-divergence as the expectation:\n$$KL(q(z) || p(z|D)) = \\mathbb{E_{z \\sim q(z)}}[log \\frac{q(z)}{p(z|D)}]$$\nwhich, taking the expectation over $z$, is equivalent to integration:\n$$\\int_{z_0}, . . .,\\int_{z_{D-1}}q(z)log\\frac{q(z)}{p(z|D)}d_{z_0},…,d_{z_{D-1}}$$\nBut, sadly we don’t have $p(z \\vert D)$ as this is the posterior! We only have the joint. Solution? Recall our KL-divergence:\n$$KL(q(z) || p(z|D))$$\nWe can rearrange the terms inside the $log$ so that we can actually compute something:\n$$\\int_{z}q(z)log(\\frac{q(z)p(D)}{p(z, D)})dz$$\nWe only have the joint. Not the posterior; nor the marginal. We know from Bayes rule that we can express the posterior in terms of the joint $p(z, D)$ divided by the marginal $p(x=D)$:\n$$p(z|D) = \\frac{p(Z, D)}{p(D)}$$\nWe plug this inside of the $log$:\n$$\\int_{z}q(z)log(\\frac{q(z)p(D)}{p(z, D)})dz$$\nHowever, the problem now is that we have reformulated our problem into another quantity that we don’t have, i.e., the marginal $p(D)$. But we can put the quantity that we don’t have outside of the $log$ to form two separate integrals.\n$$\\int_z q(z)log(\\frac{q(z)}{p(z, D)})dz + \\int_zq(z)log(p(D)dz$$\nThis is a valid rearrangement because of the properties of logarithms. In this case, the numerator is a product, so this turns into a sum of the second integral. What do we see in these two terms? We see an expectation over the quantity $\\frac{q(z)}{p(z, D)}$ and another expectation over $p(D)$. Rewriting in terms of expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E_{z{\\sim q(z)}}}[log(\\frac{q(z)}{p(z, D)})] + \\mathbb{E_{z \\sim q(z)}}[log(p(D))]$$\nThe right term contains information we know—the functional form of the surrogate $q(z)$ and the joint $p(z, D)$ (in the form of a directed graphical model). We still don’t have access to $p(D)$ on the right side, but this is a constant quantity. The expectation of a quantity that does not contain $z$ is just whatever the expectation was taken over. Because of this, we can again rearrange:\n$$-\\mathbb{E_{z \\sim q(z)}}[log \\frac{p(z, D)}{q(z)}]+log (p(D))$$\nThe minus sign is a result of the “swapping” of the numerator and denominator and is required to make it a valid change. Looking at this, the left side is a function dependent on $q$. In shorthand form, we can call this $\\mathcal{L(q)}$. Our KL-divergence is:\n$$KL = \\mathcal{-L(q)} + \\underbrace{log(p(D))}_\\textrm{evidence}$$\nwhere $p(D)$ is a value between $[0, 1]$ and this value is called the evidence which is the log probability of the data. If we apply the $log$ to something between $[0, 1]$ then this value will be negative. This value is also constant since we have observed the dataset and thus does not change.\n$KL$ is the distance (between the posterior and the surrogate) so it must be something positive. If the $KL$ is positive and the evidence is negative, then in order to fulfill this equation, $\\mathcal{L}$ must also be negative (negative times a negative is a positive). The $\\mathcal{L}$ should be smaller than the evidence, and thus it is called the lower bound of the evidence $\\rightarrow$ Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).\nAgain, ELBO is defined as: $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathbb{E_{z \\sim q(z)}}[log(\\frac{p(z, D)}{q(z)})]$ and is important to note that the ELBO is equal to the evidence if and only if the KL-divergence between the surrogate and the true posterior is $0$:\n$$\\mathcal{L(q)} = log(p(D)) \\textrm{ i.f.f. } KL(q(z)||p(z|D))=0$$\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>We don&rsquo;t know the real posterior so we are going to choose a distribution $Q(\theta)$ from a family of distributions $Q^*$ that are <strong>easy to work with</strong> and parameterized by $\theta$. The approximate distribution should be <em>as close as possible</em> to the true posterior. This closeness is measured using KL-Divergence. If we have the joint $p(x, z)$ where $x$ is some observed data, the goal is to perform inference: given what we have observed, what can we infer about the latent states?, i.e , we want the posterior.</p>
<p>Recall Bayes theorem:</p>
<p>$$p(z | x) = \frac{p(x|z)p(z)}{p(x)}$$</p>
<p>The problem is the marginal $p(x = D)$ as this could require a hundred, thousand, . . .dimensional integral:</p>
<p>$$p(x) = \int_{z_0},&hellip;,\int_{z_{D-1}}p(x, z)dz_0,&hellip;,d_{z_D{-1}}$$</p>
<p>If we want the full posterior and can&rsquo;t compute the marginal, then what&rsquo;s the solution? <strong>Surrogate posterior</strong>. We want to approximate the true posterior using some known distribution:</p>
<p>$$q(z) \approx p(z|X=D)$$</p>
<p>where $\approx$ can mean you want the approximated posterior to be &ldquo;as good as possible&rdquo;. Using variational inference, the objective is to minimize the distance between the surrogate $q(z)$ and the true posterior $p(x)$ using KL-Divergence:</p>

<p>where $Q$ is a more &ldquo;simple&rdquo; distribution. We can restate the KL-divergence as the expectation:</p>
<p>$$KL(q(z) || p(z|D)) = \mathbb{E_{z \sim q(z)}}[log \frac{q(z)}{p(z|D)}]$$</p>
<p>which, taking the expectation over $z$, is equivalent to integration:</p>
<p>$$\int_{z_0}, . . .,\int_{z_{D-1}}q(z)log\frac{q(z)}{p(z|D)}d_{z_0},&hellip;,d_{z_{D-1}}$$</p>
<p>But, sadly we don&rsquo;t have $p(z \vert D)$ as this is the posterior! We only have the joint. Solution? Recall our KL-divergence:</p>
<p>$$KL(q(z) || p(z|D))$$</p>
<p>We can rearrange the terms inside the $log$ so that we can <strong>actually</strong> compute something:</p>

<p>We only have the <strong>joint</strong>. Not the posterior; nor the marginal. We know from Bayes rule that we can express the posterior in terms of the joint $p(z, D)$ divided by the marginal $p(x=D)$:</p>
<p>$$p(z|D) = \frac{p(Z, D)}{p(D)}$$</p>
<p>We plug this inside of the $log$:</p>
<p>$$\int_{z}q(z)log(\frac{q(z)p(D)}{p(z, D)})dz$$</p>
<p>However, the problem now is that we have reformulated our problem into <strong>another</strong> quantity that we don&rsquo;t have, i.e., the marginal $p(D)$. But we can put the quantity that we don&rsquo;t have outside of the $log$ to form two separate integrals.</p>
<p>$$\int_z q(z)log(\frac{q(z)}{p(z, D)})dz + \int_zq(z)log(p(D)dz$$</p>
<p>This is a valid <em>rearrangement</em> because of the properties of logarithms. In this case, the numerator is a product, so this turns into a sum of the second integral. What do we see in these two terms? We see an expectation over the quantity $\frac{q(z)}{p(z, D)}$ and another expectation over $p(D)$. Rewriting in terms of expectation:</p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E_{z{\sim q(z)}}}[log(\frac{q(z)}{p(z, D)})] + \mathbb{E_{z \sim q(z)}}[log(p(D))]$$</p>
<p>The right term contains <strong>information we know</strong>—the functional form of the surrogate $q(z)$ and the joint $p(z, D)$ (in the form of a directed graphical model). We still don&rsquo;t have access to $p(D)$ on the right side, but this is a <strong>constant quantity</strong>.

<p>Again, ELBO is defined as: $\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E_{z \sim q(z)}}[log(\frac{p(z, D)}{q(z)})]$ and is important to note that the ELBO is equal to the evidence if and only if the KL-divergence between the surrogate and the true posterior is $0$:</p>
<p>$$\mathcal{L(q)} = log(p(D)) \textrm{ i.f.f. } KL(q(z)||p(z|D))=0$$</p>
